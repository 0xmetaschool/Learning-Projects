# Enums & Options: Rust's Power-Ups

Welcome back, Rust adventurers! You've mastered a lot of rust fundamentals topics and more.  Now, let's explore some advanced data structures that will make your Rust code more expressive, flexible, and powerful. In this lesson, we'll tackle:

- **Enums:** Representing a fixed set of choices.
- **Options:** Handling the possibility of missing values.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be equipped with a wider range of tools to model complex data and handle different scenarios in your CosmWasm smart contracts.

## Enums: Rust's Master of Disguise

In the programming world, sometimes you need to represent a set of distinct, pre-defined options. Imagine a traffic light – it can only be red, yellow, or green. You wouldn't want to store its state as a number (1, 2, or 3) because it's not immediately clear what those numbers mean. This is where enums shine!

**Enums as Categorical Types**

Enums, short for enumerations, are a way to define a custom type with a limited set of named values.  Think of them as multiple-choice answers for your code, where each choice has a specific meaning.

**Example: Coffee Sizes (with Debug powers!)**

Let's create an enum representing different coffee sizes, but this time, we'll give it the ability to tell us about itself for debugging purposes:

```solidity
#[derive(Debug)]  // This is new! It allows us to print the enum easily.
enum CoffeeSize {
    Small,
    Medium,
    Large,
}
```

In this example:

- **`CoffeeSize`:** The name of our custom enum type.
- **`Small`, `Medium`, `Large`:** The *variants* (possible values) of the `CoffeeSize` type. Each variant is like a label with a specific meaning.
- **`#[derive(Debug)]`:** This special line of code tells Rust to automatically add some behind-the-scenes code to our enum. This extra code will let us easily print the enum's value for debugging.

**Using Enums**

Once you've defined an enum, you can create variables of that type and assign them one of the variants:

```solidity
fn main() {
    // Declare a variable of type CoffeeSize and assign it the Medium variant
    let my_order: CoffeeSize = CoffeeSize::Medium;
    
    // Print the value of the variable 
    println!("Your order is: {:?}", my_order);
}
```

(Try it on your own in VS code, you know what to do correct?).

Let's break this down:

1. `let my_order: CoffeeSize = CoffeeSize::Medium;`: We create a variable named `my_order`, tell Rust it's of type `CoffeeSize`, and assign it the value `CoffeeSize::Medium`. Think of it like ordering a medium coffee.
2. `println!("Your order is: {:?}", my_order);`: We use `println!` to show us what's inside the `my_order` variable.
    - The `"{:?}"` is a special format specifier. It tells Rust to use the `Debug` implementation for `CoffeeSize` to print a user-friendly representation of the value.
    - More technically,  `#[derive(Debug)]` tells Rust to automatically generate an implementation for the `Debug` trait, which allows us to print the enum value using `{:?}` in the `println!` macro.
    - Without deriving `Debug`, we wouldn't be able to print the enum value directly. Instead, we'd need to implement the `Display` trait or use a match statement to convert the enum to a string.
    - By deriving `Debug`, we can easily inspect and print our enum values, making debugging and logging easier.

**Matching on Enums**

Rust's `match` expression is a powerful way to work with enums. It allows you to perform different actions depending on the specific variant of the enum value:

```solidity
fn main() {
    let my_order: CoffeeSize = CoffeeSize::Large;

    match my_order {
        CoffeeSize::Small => println!("Enjoy your small coffee!"),
        CoffeeSize::Medium => println!("Enjoy your medium coffee!"),
        CoffeeSize::Large => println!("Enjoy your large coffee!"),
    }
}
```

In this example, the `match` expression checks the value of `my_order` and prints a different message depending on whether it's `Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`.

In the world of CosmWasm, you'll encounter enums frequently in smart contracts, especially for representing different types of messages, queries, or contract states.

**Enum Variants with Data: Pairing Enums with Structs**

Enums can also carry data associated with each variant, often in combination with structs.  This is particularly useful when you need to represent different types of objects that share a common trait.

Let's illustrate how enums and structs can work together using a to-do list example:

**Scenario:** Imagine you're building a to-do list app where tasks can have different priorities. You want to represent these priorities in a structured way within your code.

Create a file in `src` folder with the name `enum_example.rs` and add the following code:

```solidity
#[derive(Debug)] // Add derive for Debug to allow printing
enum Priority {
    High,
    Medium,
    Low,
}

struct ToDoItem {
    task: String,
    priority: Priority, 
}

pub fn main() {
    // Create a to-do item with high priority
    let task1 = ToDoItem {
        task: String::from("Complete CosmWasm tutorial"),
        priority: Priority::High,
    };

    // Create a to-do item with medium priority
    let task2 = ToDoItem {
        task: String::from("Learn about MANTRA Chain"),
        priority: Priority::Medium,
    };

    // Create a to-do item with low priority to avoid the warning
    let task3 = ToDoItem {
        task: String::from("Take a break"),
        priority: Priority::Low,
    };

    // Print information about the tasks
    println!("Task 1: {}, Priority: {:?}", task1.task, task1.priority);
    println!("Task 2: {}, Priority: {:?}", task2.task, task2.priority);
    println!("Task 3: {}, Priority: {:?}", task3.task, task3.priority); 

    // Example of matching on the priority
    match task1.priority {
        Priority::High => println!("This task is urgent!"),
        Priority::Medium => println!("This task is important."),
        Priority::Low => println!("This task can wait."),
    }
}

```

**Code Explanation:**

1. **Deriving the `Debug` Trait:**
    - `#[derive(Debug)]`: This line is like giving your `Priority` enum a special ability to be printed out in a readable format. In Rust, certain traits (like `Debug`) need to be implemented for types if you want to print their values directly. The `derive` attribute tells Rust to automatically generate the code for implementing `Debug` for our enum, so we don't have to write it ourselves.
2. **Defining the `Priority` Enum:**
    - `enum Priority { High, Medium, Low }`: This defines an enum called `Priority`, representing the different priority levels a task can have. Enums are like multiple-choice options, where each value (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) is a distinct possibility.
3. **Defining the `ToDoItem` Struct:**
    - `struct ToDoItem { task: String, priority: Priority }`: This defines a struct called `ToDoItem` to represent a single task in our to-do list. Each task has two parts:
        - `task`: A `String` to store the description of the task.
        - `priority`: A field of type `Priority`, indicating the priority level of the task (one of the values from our enum).
4. **Creating `ToDoItem` Instances:**
    - `let task1 = ToDoItem { ... }`: This line creates a new instance of the `ToDoItem` struct.
        - `task: String::from("Complete CosmWasm tutorial")`: We initialize the `task` field with a description of the task.
        - `priority: Priority::High`: We set the `priority` field to the `High` variant of the `Priority` enum.
    - The code then creates two more instances, `task2` and `task3`, with different descriptions and priority levels.
5. **Printing Task Information:**
    - `println!("Task 1: {}, Priority: {:?}", task1.task, task1.priority);`:
        - This line prints a message that includes the task description (`task1.task`) and priority (`task1.priority`).
        - The `{:?}` format specifier is used because the `priority` field is an enum, and we've derived the `Debug` trait for it. This tells Rust to print the enum variant's name (e.g., "High").
    - The code then prints similar messages for `task2` and `task3`.
6. **Matching on Priority (Decision Making):**
    - `match task1.priority { ... }`: This is a `match` expression, which is a powerful control flow construct in Rust. It allows you to perform different actions depending on the value of an expression (in this case, `task1.priority`).
    - `Priority::High => println!("This task is urgent!")`: If the priority is `High`, it prints "This task is urgent!".
    - `Priority::Medium => println!("This task is important.")`: If the priority is `Medium`, it prints "This task is important."
    - `Priority::Low => println!("This task can wait.")`: If the priority is `Low`, it prints "This task can wait."

## Options: Embracing the "Maybe" in Your Rust Code

In the world of code, sometimes you encounter situations where a value might be there... or it might not be. Maybe you're searching for a user in a database, but they don't exist. Or perhaps you're trying to calculate a result, but the input data is invalid. How do you handle these "maybe" situations without causing your program to crash and burn?

Enter the Option type, Rust's elegant solution for representing optional values.

**The Option Enum: A Box with a Surprise (or Not!)**

Think of `Option` as a box that either contains a gift or is empty. You don't know which one it is until you open it.  In Rust, the `Option` type is an enum with two variants:

- `Some(T)`: This variant represents a box with a present inside. The `T` can be any type of data – a number, a string, a struct, you name it!
- `None`: This variant represents an empty box, indicating that there's no value.

```solidity
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

- **`Option<T>`:** This is a generic enum, meaning it can hold a value of any type (`T`).
- **`Some(T)`:** This variant indicates that there's a value present, and it holds the actual value of type `T`.
- **`None`:** This variant indicates that there's no value.

## Example: Optional Bonus Points

Let's say you're writing a program to calculate a student's grade, and there's a possibility of bonus points. We can model this uncertainty using an `Option`:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let base_score: i32 = 85;
    let bonus_points: Option<i32> = Some(5); // Some bonus points
    //let bonus_points: Option<i32> = None;   // No bonus points

    let final_score = match bonus_points {
        Some(points) => base_score + points,
        None => base_score,
    };

    println!("Final Score: {}", final_score);
}

```

In this example:

- We create a variable `bonus_points` of type `Option<i32>`. It is initialized to `Some(5)`, indicating that the student earned 5 bonus points.
- The `match` expression checks whether `bonus_points` is `Some` or `None`.
    - If it's `Some`, we extract the value using `points` and add it to the `base_score`.
    - If it's `None`, we simply use the `base_score` as the final score.
- If we uncomment the line  `let bonus_points: Option<i32> = None;`, the output would be "Final Score: 85" since there are no bonus points.

**Why Options are Essential:**

By using the `Option` type, you make your code more robust and prevent errors caused by trying to access values that might not exist.  It's a core concept in Rust's error handling strategy and helps you write safer, more reliable code.

## Wrap Up

Congratulations! You've just expanded your Rust knowledge with enums and options. With enums, you've learned how to represent choices or categories within your code, making it clearer and more expressive. And with options, you've gained the ability to gracefully handle scenarios where values might be missing, enhancing the robustness of your applications.

But hold on tight, because we're not done yet! In our next adventure, we'll tackle two more powerful tools in Rust's arsenal: vectors and attributes. Vectors will allow you to store and manipulate collections of data, while attributes will let you add special metadata to your code. Get ready to level up your Rust toolkit once again!
