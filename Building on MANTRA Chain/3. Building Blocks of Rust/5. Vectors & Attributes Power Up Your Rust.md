# Vectors & Attributes:  Power Up Your Rust Data Arsenal

Get ready to level up your Rust programming skills, CosmWasm explorers! In this lesson, we're adding two powerful tools to your toolbox: vectors and attributes.

## Vectors: Your Dynamic Data Collection

Imagine you're hosting a party, but you're not sure how many guests are coming.  You need a way to store everyone's names, but you don't want to limit yourself to a fixed number of invitations. That's where vectors come in handy!

Vectors (`Vec<T>`) in Rust are like expandable lists.  You can add or remove items as needed, making them perfect for storing collections of data that might change over time.

**Creating and Manipulating Vectors**

Creating a vector is a breeze:

```solidity
// Create an empty vector to hold i32 integers
let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); 
```

Adding elements is just as easy:

```solidity
numbers.push(10);
numbers.push(25);
numbers.push(5);
```

You can also access elements by their index (remember, indexing starts at zero):

```solidity
let second_number = numbers[1]; 
println!("The second number is: {}", second_number); // Output: 25
```

Combining all:

```solidity
fn main()
{
		// Create an empty vector to hold i32 integers
    let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new(); 
    numbers.push(10);
    numbers.push(25);
    numbers.push(5);
    let second_number = numbers[1]; 
    println!("The second number is: {}", second_number); // Output: 25
}
```

### Vectors Within Structs: Storing Multiple Items

Let's say you want to create a struct called `ShoppingList` that can hold multiple items. You can use a vector inside the struct to store this list, letâ€™s create a file called `vector_example.rs` and add this code:

```solidity
struct ShoppingListItem {
    name: String,
    quantity: u32,
}

struct ShoppingList {
    items: Vec<ShoppingListItem>,
}

pub fn main() {
    let mut my_list = ShoppingList { items: Vec::new() };

    my_list.items.push(ShoppingListItem {
        name: String::from("Apples"),
        quantity: 3,
    });
    my_list.items.push(ShoppingListItem {
        name: String::from("Bananas"),
        quantity: 5,
    });
    my_list.items.push(ShoppingListItem {
        name: String::from("Milk"),
        quantity: 1,
    });

    for item in my_list.items {
        println!("{}: {}", item.name, item.quantity);
    }
}
```

Let's break down this code step-by-step to understand how structs and vectors work together to create a shopping list:

**Defining the Building Blocks**

- `struct ShoppingListItem { name: String, quantity: u32 }`:
    - This defines a structure called `ShoppingListItem` to represent individual items on your list.
    - Each item has two properties:
        - `name`: A `String` to store the name of the item (e.g., "Apples").
        - `quantity`: A `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer) to store the quantity of the item (e.g., 3).
- `struct ShoppingList { items: Vec<ShoppingListItem> }`:
    - This defines a structure called `ShoppingList`.
    - It has one field:
        - `items`: A `Vec<ShoppingListItem>`, which is a vector (a resizable list) to store multiple `ShoppingListItem` structures. Think of this as a way to hold all the items in your shopping cart.

**2. Creating an Empty Shopping List**

- `let mut my_list = ShoppingList { items: Vec::new() };`:
    - This creates a mutable variable `my_list` that holds a `ShoppingList` instance.
    - Inside the curly braces `{}`, we're initializing the `items` field with a new, empty vector. We use `Vec::new()` to create an empty vector of `ShoppingListItem` structs. The `mut` keyword makes the `my_list` variable mutable, allowing us to add items to it later.

**3. Adding Items to the Shopping List**

- `my_list.items.push(ShoppingListItem { ... });`: This line adds a new item to the `my_list.items` vector. The `push` method is used to add an element to the end of a vector.
    - Inside the `push` method, we create a new `ShoppingListItem` struct, providing values for its `name` and `quantity` fields.
    - The code repeats this `push` operation three times to add "Apples," "Bananas," and "Milk" to the shopping list.

**4. Iterating and Printing the Shopping List**

- `for item in my_list.items { ... }`: This is a `for` loop that iterates over each item in the `my_list.items` vector.
    - For each iteration, the `item` variable holds a reference to a single `ShoppingListItem` struct within the vector.
    - `println!("{}: {}", item.name, item.quantity);`: This line prints the name and quantity of the current `item` to the console.

**Output:**

When you run the code, the output will be:

```solidity
Apples: 3
Bananas: 5
Milk: 1
```

This demonstrates how to create a struct to represent a collection of items using a vector. We are using this to create a shopping list where each item is represented as another struct (`ShoppingListItem`).

## Attributes: Your Code's Secret Messages

Ever left yourself a sticky note reminder on your computer screen? Or maybe flagged an important email? Attributes in Rust are kind of like that - they're little notes you attach to your code to give it special instructions or add metadata. While not part of the core logic of your program, attributes can be incredibly useful for various tasks, from customizing how your code compiles to integrating with external libraries.

### Anatomy of an Attribute

In Rust, attributes look like this:

```solidity
#[attribute_name(optional_parameters)]
```

They start with a `#` followed by square brackets `[]`, containing the attribute name and, optionally, some parameters.  You place them right before the item you want to annotate (like a function, struct, or module).

### Why Use Attributes?

Attributes serve different purposes, depending on their name and parameters.  They can:

- **Provide configuration for the compiler:** Tell the compiler how to optimize code, enable language features, or even conditionally compile certain parts of your code.
- **Add information for documentation tools:** Help generate better documentation for your code.
- **Enable features from external libraries:** Integrate your code with external libraries that use attributes for configuration or code generation.
- **Customize tests and benchmarks:** Control how your tests are run or how your code is benchmarked.

### Example: Serde for Serialization and Deserialization

One of the most common attributes you'll encounter in CosmWasm is `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`. This attribute, provided by the `serde` library, is used for serializing and deserializing data structures.

**Serialization: Turning Data into a Portable Format**

- Think of serialization as packing your belongings into a suitcase for a trip. You take your clothes, toiletries, and other items and neatly arrange them into a compact, portable format that can be easily transported.
- In programming, serialization does something similar for data. It takes a complex data structure (like a struct or enum) and converts it into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted over a network.  Common serialization formats include JSON, XML, and binary formats.

**Deserialization: Unpacking Your Data**

- Now, imagine arriving at your destination and unpacking your suitcase. You take out your belongings and restore them to their original form so you can use them.
- Deserialization is the reverse of serialization. It takes the serialized data (e.g., a JSON string) and converts it back into its original data structure (like a struct or enum) so that you can work with it in your code.

**Why Serialization and Deserialization Matter for Smart Contracts**

In the world of blockchain and smart contracts, serialization and deserialization are crucial for several reasons:

- Smart contracts need to store their state (data) on the blockchain. Serialization allows them to store complex data structures in a compact and efficient format.
- Smart contracts communicate with each other and with external clients by sending messages. These messages typically contain data that needs to be serialized before being sent and deserialized upon receipt.
- Different blockchain platforms and applications might use different serialization formats. By using a common format like JSON, you can ensure that your smart contracts can interact with a wider range of systems and tools.

Rust provides a powerful library called Serde for handling serialization and deserialization. It works with a variety of data formats, including JSON, and makes it incredibly easy to convert your Rust data structures to and from these formats.

We will see its implementation and usage while creating our to-do dApp in later lessons.

## Wrap Up

Fantastic! You've just expanded your Rust knowledge with a powerful new data structure: vectors! You now understand how to create dynamic lists that can grow and shrink as needed, making it easy to manage collections of data within your CosmWasm smart contracts. You've also been introduced to the concept of attributes, those handy little annotations that can add metadata to your code and unlock new functionality.

In the next lesson, we'll shift gears. Get ready for a hands-on demonstration where we'll compile and deploy our first "Hello World" CosmWasm smart contract on the MANTRA testnet. This exciting step will bring your code to life on the blockchain, opening the door to a world of possibilities!
