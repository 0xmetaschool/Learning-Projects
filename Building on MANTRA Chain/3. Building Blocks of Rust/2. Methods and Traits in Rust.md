# Methods and Traits in Rust

Welcome back, Rust adventurers! You've mastered the art of working with individual data types and functions, and now it's time to level up your skills even further! In this lesson, we'll explore two powerful concepts that will enhance your ability to create custom data types and define shared behavior: structs and traits.  Structs are like blueprints for building complex data structures, while traits are like contracts that define how different types should behave.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create custom structs with multiple fields and functions, making your code more organized, reusable, and expressive. And with traits, you'll learn how to define shared behavior for different types, paving the way for building more flexible and powerful applications. So, get ready to elevate your Rust expertise and take another step towards building awesome dApps on MANTRA Chain!

## Methods: Actions for Your Structs

Alright, now that you've mastered the art of creating structs, it's time to give them some superpowers! In Rust, we can add functions directly to our structs, turning them into objects that can *do* things, not just *hold* data. These special functions are called methods, and they're the key to making your code more organized, reusable, and expressive.

Imagine you're building a car in code. You wouldn't just create a blueprint with the car's attributes (like color, model, and year); you'd also want to define what the car can *do* (like accelerate, brake, or turn). In Rust, methods are like the car's actions – they're functions that are specifically associated with a particular struct.

They're defined within an `impl` (implementation) block for the struct, and they have special access to the struct's data fields.

Here's the basic syntax for defining a method:

```solidity
impl NameOfStruct {
    fn method_name(&self, other_parameters) -> return_type {
        // Code that the method executes
    }
}
```

- `impl`: This keyword indicates that you're providing an implementation for a type (in this case, a struct).
- `NameOfStruct`: The name of the struct you're adding methods to.
- `fn method_name(&self, other_parameters) -> return_type`:
    - `fn`: This keyword indicates a function definition.
    - `method_name`: A descriptive name for your method.
    - `(&self, other_parameters)`: The parameter list. The first parameter is always `&self`, which is a reference to the struct instance itself. You can add other parameters after `&self` if needed.
    - `-> return_type`: This specifies the data type that the method returns (if any).

**Coding Example**

1. Let’s create a new file in `src` folder with the name `method_example.rs`.
2. Let's create a `Rectangle` struct and add some methods to it:

```solidity
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // Method to calculate the area of a rectangle
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height 
    }

    // Method to check if a rectangle is a square
    fn is_square(&self) -> bool {
        self.width == self.height
    }
}
```

3. In this example:
    - The `area` method takes `&self` (a reference to the Rectangle instance) and calculates the area by multiplying the width and height. It then returns the area as a `u32` integer.
    - The `is_square` method also takes `&self` and returns a `bool` (true if the rectangle is a square, false otherwise).
4. Now let's use these methods in our `main` function:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let my_rect = Rectangle { width: 5, height: 10 };
    let area = my_rect.area();
    println!("The area of the rectangle is: {}", area); // Output: 50
    println!("Is it a square? {}", my_rect.is_square()); // Output: false
}
```

By calling the methods using dot notation (`.area()` and `.is_square()`), we can perform operations specific to our `Rectangle` struct in a clean and intuitive way.

## Traits in Rust: Contracts for Behavior

In Rust, a trait is like a contract that defines a set of behaviors a type must implement.  It's a way of saying, "If you want to be considered this kind of thing, you need to be able to do these specific actions."

### Why Traits?

Traits are a powerful tool for abstraction and code reuse in Rust. They allow you to:

- **Define shared behavior:** Group together common functionality that different types might share.
- **Enable polymorphism:** Write generic code that can work with multiple types that implement the same trait.
- **Enforce constraints:** Ensure that types used in certain contexts adhere to specific requirements.

### Defining a Trait

Here's the basic syntax for defining a trait:

```solidity
trait TraitName {
    fn method_signature1(&self, arg1: Type1, arg2: Type2) -> ReturnType;
    fn method_signature2(&self); // Methods can also have no arguments or return values
    // ...more methods...
}
```

Let's define a trait for a shape:

```solidity
trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64; // Method to calculate the area
    fn name(&self) -> &str; // Method to return the name of the shape
}
```

This `Shape` trait requires any type that implements it to have two methods:

- `area`: Calculates the area of the shape and returns it as an `f64` floating-point number.
- `name`: Returns the name of the shape as a string slice (`&str`).

### Implementing a Trait

To make a type (like a struct) conform to a trait, you need to implement its methods within an `impl` block:

```solidity
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius 
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "circle"
    }
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "rectangle"
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- These two structs define different shapes:
    - `Circle`: Represents a circle with a `radius` property.
    - `Rectangle`: Represents a rectangle with `width` and `height` properties.

```solidity
impl Shape for Circle { ... }
impl Shape for Rectangle { ... }
```

- These blocks of code are where we actually teach each shape how to fulfill the `Shape` contract. We do this by providing specific implementations for the `area` and `name` methods within each struct's context.
- Let's break down the Circle implementation:
    - `fn area(&self) -> f64 { ... }`: This function calculates the area of a circle (pi * radius * radius) and returns it as an `f64`.
    - `std::f64::consts::PI` is the way you access the value of pi from the Rust standard library.  It's a double-precision floating-point number, which makes it suitable for accurate calculations involving circles in the `area` method.
    - We can add `use std::f64::consts::PI;` in the beginning to directly use `PI` in calculation.
    - `fn name(&self) -> &str { ... }`: This function simply returns the string "circle" as the name of the shape.
- **Rectangle's implementation is similar:**
    - `fn area(&self) -> f64 { ... }`: This function calculates the area of a rectangle (width * height) and returns it as an `f64`.
    - `fn name(&self) -> &str { ... }`: This function returns the string "rectangle".

**Completing the code:**

- Create a new file with the name `trait_example.rs` and add the following code:

```solidity
use std::f64::consts::PI;

trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "circle"
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Shape for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "rectangle"
    }
}

pub fn main() {
    let my_circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
    let my_rectangle = Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 6.0 };

    println!(
        "The area of the {} is {}",
        my_circle.name(),
        my_circle.area()
    );
    println!(
        "The area of the {} is {}",
        my_rectangle.name(),
        my_rectangle.area()
    );
}
```

This showcases how the `Shape` trait allows us to write code that can work with multiple different types of shapes (circles and rectangles in this case) in a uniform way. This is the power of polymorphism in action!
