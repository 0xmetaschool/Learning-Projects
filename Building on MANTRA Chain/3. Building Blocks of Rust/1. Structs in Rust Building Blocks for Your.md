# Structs in Rust: Building Blocks for Your Data

Welcome back, Rust adventurers! You've mastered the art of working with individual data types like integers, strings, and booleans, and you've even learned how to command your code with functions. Now, get ready to take your Rust skills to the next level as we explore the power of structs.

Think of structs as blueprints for building custom data structures. They're like containers that can hold multiple pieces of related information together, making your code more organized, expressive, and efficient.  In the world of CosmWasm smart contracts, structs are essential for modeling complex data, such as token information, user profiles, or even the entire state of your application.

## Struct Basics: What, Why, and How

A struct is a user-defined data type that lets you group together multiple fields, each with its own name and type. It's like a form with labelled fields, where each field can hold a different type of information.

Here's the basic syntax for defining a struct:

```solidity
struct NameOfStruct {
    field1_name: field1_type,
    field2_name: field2_type,
    // ...more fields...
}
```

Let's say you're building a dApp for managing a library of books. You could create a `Book` struct to represent each book:

```solidity
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    year_published: u16,
    is_available: bool,
}
```

In this struct, we have four fields:

- `title`: A `String` to store the book's title.
- `author`: A `String` to store the author's name.
- `year_published`: A `u16` (unsigned 16-bit integer) to store the year the book was published.
- `is_available`: A `bool` to indicate whether the book is currently available for borrowing.

### Creating and Using Structs

1. To create an instance of a struct, you use the following syntax:

```solidity
let my_book = Book {
    title: String::from("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"),
    author: String::from("Douglas Adams"),
    year_published: 1979,
    is_available: true,
};
```

1. Once you've created a struct instance, you can access its fields using `dot` notation:

```solidity
println!("Title: {}", my_book.title); 
// Output: "Title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
```

1. Let’s write the complete code, first create a new file in `src` folder with the name `struct_example.rs`.
2. Add the following code in `struct_example.rs` file

```solidity
// Define the Book struct
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    year_published: u16,
    is_available: bool,
}

pub fn main() {
    // Create an instance of the Book struct
    let my_book = Book {
        title: String::from("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"),
        author: String::from("Douglas Adams"),
        year_published: 1979,
        is_available: true,
    };
    println!("Book title: {}" ,my_book.title);
    println!("Book author: {}",my_book.author);
    println!("Book was published in the year: {}", my_book.year_published);
    println!("Is the book {}, available for borrowing? {}", my_book.title, my_book.is_available);
}

```

1. **Structure Definition:** The code starts by defining a struct named `Book`. This struct serves as a blueprint for creating book objects. It outlines the specific information each book object will contain:
    - `title`: The title of the book, stored as a `String` (a sequence of characters).
    - `author`: The author of the book, also stored as a `String`.
    - `year_published`: The year the book was published, stored as a `u16` (unsigned 16-bit integer).
    - `is_available`: A boolean value (`bool`) that indicates whether the book is available for borrowing (`true`) or not (`false`).
2. **Creating a `Book` Instance:** Inside `main`, the line `let my_book = Book { ... };` creates a new book object named `my_book`. The curly braces `{}` are used to initialize the fields of the struct:
    - `title`: Set to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
    - `author`: Set to "Douglas Adams".
    - `year_published`: Set to 1979.
    - `is_available`: Set to `true`.
3. **Accessing Fields:**
    - `println!("Book title: {}" ,my_book.title);` accesses the book's title and prints it to the console.
    - `println!("Book author: {}",my_book.author);` accesses the book's author and prints it to the console.
    - `println!("Book was published in the year: {}", my_book.year_published);` accesses the book's year_published and prints it to the console.
    - `println!("Is the book {}, available for borrowing? {}", my_book.title, my_book.is_available);` accesses the book's title and is_available properties, and prints both to the console. The values are accessed using dot notation (e.g., `my_book.title`).

## Coding Challenge: The Token Tracker

Now it's your turn to create a struct and write some code!

**Your Task:**

Your mission is to build a program that defines a `Token` struct to represent a cryptocurrency token. Your `Token` struct should have the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the token (`String`)
- `symbol`: The token's ticker symbol (`String`)
- `total_supply`: The total number of tokens in existence (`u64`)
- `price`: The current price of one token (`f64`)

After you've defined your struct, write a function called `print_token_info` that takes a `Token` as input and prints all the information about it to the console. Then, create an instance of the `Token` struct in your `main` function with details about your favorite cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, OM, etc.), and call `print_token_info` to display those details.

We hope you have tried it on your own. 

**Let’s see the code and explanation:**

1. Create a file under src called `token_info.rs` and next define the token struct:

```solidity
struct Token {
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    total_supply: u64,
    price: f64,
}
```

- We create a struct called `Token` to represent a cryptocurrency token.
    - Each `Token` will have four fields to store its information:
        - `name`: The full name of the token (e.g., "Bitcoin").
        - `symbol`: The token's ticker symbol (e.g., "BTC").
        - `total_supply`: The total number of tokens in existence.
        - `price`: The current market price of one token.
2. Create the `print_token_info` function:

```solidity
fn print_token_info(token: &Token) {
    println!("Token Name: {}", token.name);
    println!("Token Symbol: {}", token.symbol);
    println!("Total Supply: {}", token.total_supply);
    println!("Current Price: ${:.2}", token.price); // Display price with 2 decimal places
}
```

- This function takes a reference to a `Token` instance as input (`token: &Token`).
- It then uses `println!` statements to neatly display each field of the token: its `name`, `symbol`, `total_supply`, and `price`.
- Notice the use of the `:.2` formatting specifier in the price output to display only two decimal places.
3. Create a token instance in the `main` function:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let my_favorite_token = Token {
        name: String::from("Ethereum"),
        symbol: String::from("ETH"),
        total_supply: 120_230_000, // Approximate current supply as of Jul 2024
        price: 3266.52,        // Example price in USD
    };

    // Call the print_token_info function
    print_token_info(&my_favorite_token);
}
```

- We create a `Token` instance named `my_favorite_token` and initialize its fields with the data for Ethereum.
- We then call the `print_token_info` function, passing the `my_favorite_token` instance as an argument (using the `&` to pass a reference).
4. Here is the complete code and don’t forget to add it to `main.rs`:

```solidity
struct Token {
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    total_supply: u64,
    price: f64,
}

fn print_token_info(token: &Token) {
    println!("Token Name: {}", token.name);
    println!("Token Symbol: {}", token.symbol);
    println!("Total Supply: {}", token.total_supply);
    println!("Current Price: ${:.2}", token.price); // Display price with 2 decimal places
}

pub fn main() {
    let my_favorite_token = Token {
        name: String::from("Ethereum"),
        symbol: String::from("ETH"),
        total_supply: 120_230_000, // Approximate current supply as of Jul 2024
        price: 3266.52,        // Example price in USD
    };

    // Call the print_token_info function
    print_token_info(&my_favorite_token);
}
```

5. The output is:

```solidity
Token Name: Ethereum
Token Symbol: ETH
Total Supply: 120230000
Current Price: $3266.52
```
