# Modules in Rust: Organize Your Code Like a Pro

Welcome back, Rust architects! In our last lesson, we gave superpowers to our data structures with methods and traits. Now, let's zoom out and look at the bigger picture of organizing our Rust code.  As our CosmWasm smart contracts become more sophisticated, keeping our code neat and tidy is crucial for maintainability and collaboration. 

That's where modules come in – think of them as the dividers in your toolbox, keeping your wrenches separate from your screwdrivers. In this lesson, we'll learn how to use modules to create well-structured, reusable code that's ready to tackle complex dApps on MANTRA Chain.

## What are Modules? Your Code's Filing Cabinets

Imagine a library with thousands of books scattered randomly on the floor. Finding the right book would be a nightmare! That's why libraries use a system of shelves, sections, and catalogs to organize their collection.

Modules in Rust serve a similar purpose. They are like virtual "filing cabinets" that allow you to group related code together, making it easier to navigate, manage, and reuse.

## Why Use Modules?

Modules provide several key benefits:

- **Organization:** They help you break down your code into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of having one giant file, you can split your code into multiple modules, each responsible for a specific part of your program's functionality.
- **Encapsulation:** Modules can control the visibility of items (functions, structs, etc.) within them. You can make some items public (accessible from outside the module) and others private (accessible only within the module). This helps you hide implementation details and create clean interfaces for interacting with your code.
- **Namespace Management:** Modules prevent naming collisions. You can have functions or structs with the same name in different modules without any conflicts.
- **Reusability:** By grouping related code into modules, you can easily reuse them in other parts of your project or even in different projects altogether.

## **Creating and Using Modules**

Creating a module in Rust is as simple as using the `mod` keyword followed by the module name. 

Add the below code in a new file under `src` folder with the name `modulesExample.rs`:

```solidity
mod utils {  // Declare a module named 'utils'
    pub fn double(x: i32) -> i32 {  // A public function within the module
        x * 2
    }
}

fn main() {
    let result = utils::double(5);  // Accessing the 'double' function from the 'utils' module
    println!("Double of 5 is: {}", result);
}

```

In this example, we've created a module called `utils` that contains a single function, `double`.  The `pub` keyword before the function definition makes it accessible from outside the module. In the `main` function, we use the `::` (double colon) operator to access the `double` function from the `utils` module.

### Multiple Files and Nested Modules

You can also split your modules into separate files and even create nested modules.  For example, you could have a `math` module that contains submodules for `arithmetic` and `geometry`:

```solidity
my_project/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs      // Main entry point
│   ├── math/
│   │   ├── mod.rs  // Module declaration
│   │   ├── arithmetic.rs 
│   │   └── geometry.rs 
```

Let's take what we've learned about modules and put it into practice. We'll create a mini-library for mathematical operations and use it within our main Rust file.

1. **Step 1: Create a New Module**
- In your `rust_basics` project, create a new file named `math_utils.rs` within the `src` directory.
- Inside `math_utils.rs`, define a module called `math`:

```solidity
pub mod math { // Declare a public module named 'math'
    pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { // Public function within the module
        a + b
    }

    fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { // Private function within the module
        a - b
    }
}
```

- We have two functions in this module
    - add - which is public as it will be used in the main file.
    - subtract - it is private so it will only be used within the file math_utils.rs
    
1. **Step 2: Import and Use the Module**
- Open your `modulesExample.rs` file.
- At the beginning of the file, add the following line to import the `math` module:

```solidity
mod math_utils; // Import the module from math_utils.rs
```

- `mod math_utils;` brings the entire contents of the `math_utils.rs` file into the scope of your main file as a module.
- This module acts as a container for the nested `math` submodule, allowing you to control the visibility of its functions.
- Now, let’s complete the main():

```solidity

fn main() {
    // Accessing the public function
    let sum = math_utils::math::add(5, 3); 
    println!("5 + 3 = {}", sum); // Output: 5 + 3 = 8

    // Trying to access the private function directly (will result in an error)
    //let diff = math_utils::math::subtract(5, 3);  // Error: function is private
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Module Import:** The line `mod math_utils;` brings the `math_utils` module (defined in the `math_utils.rs` file) into the scope of this file.
- **Accessing Public Function:** The line `let sum = math_utils::math::add(5, 3);` calls the `add` function from the `math` module within `math_utils`. The double colon `::` is used to navigate the module hierarchy. Since `add` is marked `pub`, it's accessible from outside the module.
- **Trying to Access Private Function:** The commented-out line `//let diff = math_utils::math::subtract(5, 3);` attempts to call the `subtract` function directly, but it results in a compilation error because `subtract` is private and can only be used within the `math_utils` module itself.

**Important Note:** In a real project, you might choose to make some functions private if they are meant to be internal helper functions used by other functions within the module. This helps to encapsulate your code and prevent accidental misuse from outside the module.

### `use` keyword

In Rust, the `use` keyword is used to bring external items (like functions, structs, enums, modules, or traits) from other crates (libraries) or modules into the current scope. This makes it more convenient to reference those items in your code without having to write their full paths every time.

For instance, in the previous example where we had a `math` module defined within a file called `math_utils.rs`, you could import the `add` function like this:

```solidity
use math_utils::math::add;
```

This allows you to use the `add` function directly in your code, like so:

```solidity
let sum = add(5, 3);
```

This is really helpful when you need to use a function multiple times in the file.

## Wrap Up

In this lesson, you learned how to harness the power of modules in Rust to organize your code, improve readability, and promote reusability. We'll delve deeper into the use of modules and the `use` keyword throughout this course, especially when building our to-do dApp.  But for now, just remember that modules are your friends when it comes to organizing your Rust code and making it more modular and reusable!

In the next lesson we will learning about Enums and Options, these will be used a lot when we are developing our dApp later in the course.
