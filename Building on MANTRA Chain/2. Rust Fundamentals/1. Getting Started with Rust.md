# Getting Started with Rust

Welcome back, developers! It's time to roll up your sleeves and get hands-on with Rust, the programming language that fuels the magic of CosmWasm. Remember, no prior Rust experience is required – we'll walk you through the essentials step by step. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a grasp of Rust's fundamental concepts, including variables, data types, printing output, and functions, along with practical coding examples to solidify your understanding.

Okay, let's get our hands dirty with Rust! We'll cover the essential syntax and project structure you'll need to start coding. Don't worry if you're new to Rust; we'll take it step by step. But first, let's set up our coding playground.

## Setting Up Your Rust Project

1. **Fire up your terminal:** We'll use our trusty command line to create our project directory and initialize a new Rust project using Cargo, Rust's package manager.
2. **Create a new project:** In your terminal, navigate to your desired workspace and run:

```solidity
cargo new rust_basics
cd rust_basics
```

This will create a new directory called `rust_basics` with the basic structure for a Rust project.

3. **Open in VS Code:** Open the `rust_basics` directory in VS Code. You should see a `src` directory containing a file called `main.rs`. This is where we'll write our Rust code. Notice that a “Hello, world!” code is already written in the `main.rs` file.

4. Lets update the code to print “Hello, MANTRA Chain!”, instead of “Hello, world!”. (Don’t forget to save the file after editing).

    This code defines a function called `main`, which is the entry point of any Rust program. Inside the function, we use the `println!` macro to print the message "Hello, MANTRA Chain!" to the console. We will see both functions and println in detail later in the lesson.
    
5. Now in the terminal of VS Code, execute the following command to run the code.

```solidity
cargo run
```

This will compile your code and, if there are no errors, execute it. You should see the following output:

```solidity
Hello, MANTRA Chain!
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

Congratulations! You've just run your first Rust program. It might be a simple "Hello, MANTRA Chain!" example, but it's a significant step in your journey to becoming a CosmWasm developer. In the next sections, we'll explore more Rust fundamentals that will empower you to build powerful smart contracts on MANTRA Chain.

## Variables: Your Code's Storage Containers

In Rust, variables are like labeled boxes where you can store different types of information. Think of them as little containers that hold values, which can be numbers, text, or other kinds of data.

To create a variable, you use the `let` keyword, give it a name, and assign it a value:

```solidity
let message = "Hello, MANTRA Chain!";
```

Here, we've created a variable called `message` and stored the text "Hello, MANTRA Chain!" inside it.

Now, let's put this into action with a hands-on example in your Rust project:

1. **Open your `main.rs` file:** This is where we'll write our code.
2. **Declare a variable:** Add this line of code to your `main` function:

```solidity
let greeting = "Greetings from MANTRA Chain!";
```

3. **Print the variable:** Add this line to print the value of your variable:

```solidity
println!("{}", greeting);
```

`{}`:  This is a placeholder within the string. It tells Rust that you want to insert the value of a variable at this position in the output. In our example, we're inserting the value of the `greeting` variable.

4. Your complete `main.rs` file should now look like this:

```solidity
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Greetings from MANTRA Chain!";
    println!("{}", greeting); 
}
```

5. **Run your code:** Save the file and run the following command:

```solidity
cargo run
```

6. You should see "Greetings from MANTRA Chain!" printed in your terminal! You've successfully created a variable and used it in your Rust program.

**Let's see another example:**

```solidity
fn main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    println!("My name is {} and I am {} years old.", name, age);
}
```

1. **Variable Declaration:**
    - `let name = "Alice";`: This line creates a variable named `name` and assigns it the string value "Alice".
    - `let age = 30;`: This line creates another variable named `age` and assigns it the integer value 30.
2. **String Formatting with `println!`:**
    - `println!("My name is {} and I am {} years old.", name, age);`: This line uses the `println!` macro to print a formatted string to the console.
        - The string `"My name is {} and I am {} years old."` contains two curly brace placeholders `{}`. These placeholders act as markers where the values of the `name` and `age` variables will be inserted.
        - After the string, you see `, name, age`. This part provides the values to be inserted into the placeholders. The values are passed in the same order as the placeholders appear in the string.
3. When you run this code, it will produce the following output:

```solidity
My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

## Mutable vs. Immutable: Rust's Changeable and Unchangeable Values

In Rust, every variable has a superpower: it's either mutable or immutable.

**Immutable Variables:** These are the constants of Rust, the values that stay the same throughout your program. Once you set their value, it's fixed and cannot be changed.

For example, in our earlier example:

```solidity
let greeting = "Greetings from MANTRA Chain!";
```

The variable `greeting` is immutable. It will always hold the value "Greetings from MANTRA Chain!", and any attempt to change it would result in an error. This might seem restrictive, but it's a powerful feature that helps prevent accidental changes to important values.

**Mutable Variables:** These are the shape-shifters of the Rust world. They can change their value as your program runs, adapting to new information or situations.

To create a mutable variable, you simply add the `mut` keyword before the variable name:

```solidity
let mut count = 0;
count = 10; // This is allowed because 'count' is mutable
```

In this case, we first create a mutable variable called `count` and set its initial value to 0. Later, we can easily change its value to 10.

Try to print the value of count before and after update and see the output.

```solidity
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    println!("First value = {}", count);
    count = 10; // This is allowed because 'count' is mutable
    println!("Update value = {}", count);
}
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

**Why Mutability Matters:**

Mutable variables are essential for creating dynamic programs that can respond to changes. In the context of smart contracts, mutability allows you to update the state of your contract based on user interactions or other events on the blockchain.

**Important Note:**

While mutability is powerful, it's important to use it carefully. In Rust, you need to explicitly declare a variable as mutable, which helps prevent accidental changes to values that should remain constant. This emphasis on explicitness is part of Rust's design philosophy, promoting safe and reliable code.

## That’s a Wrap

Woohoo! We've just taken our first steps into the exciting world of Rust programming. We've covered the essentials like variables, immutability, mutability, and even got our hands dirty by creating and running our first Rust program.

But hold onto your hats, because this is just the tip of the iceberg! Rust has a whole lot more to offer, and we'll be exploring its rich features in our next lesson. We'll delve into data types, functions, macros, and other powerful concepts that will empower you to create sophisticated CosmWasm smart contracts on the MANTRA Chain.

So, pat yourself on the back for a job well done, grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage), and get ready for the next level of Rust programming adventure!
