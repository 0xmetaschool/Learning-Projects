# Functions in Rust: Your Code's Action Heroes

Welcome back, adventurers! In our previous lessons, we conquered the world of strings and operators. Now, it's time to unleash the power of functions, the action heroes of your Rust code.

## What are Functions? Your Code's Superpowers

Imagine you're writing a recipe for a delicious MANTRA Chain-themed smoothie. You wouldn't write out the instructions for blending the ingredients every time you mention it in the recipe, right? Instead, you'd create a function called "blend_ingredients" and simply call it whenever needed.

Functions in Rust are similar. They're self-contained blocks of code that you can name and reuse throughout your program. They help you organize your code, make it more readable, and avoid repetition. Think of them as your code's superpowers, each with a specific purpose and ability.

### **The Anatomy of a Rust Function**

Let's dissect a basic Rust function:

```solidity
fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    greet("MANTRA Developer"); // Calling the greet function
}
```

- `fn`: This keyword indicates that you're defining a function.
- `greet`: This is the name of the function. Choose descriptive names that reflect what the function does.
- `(name: &str)`: This is the function's parameter list. It specifies the type of data (`&str` for a string slice) that the function expects as input. In this case, the function `greet` expects a string slice named `name`.
- `{` and `}`: These curly braces enclose the function's body – the code that will be executed when the function is called.
- `println!("Hello, {}!", name);`: This line prints a greeting message to the console, inserting the value of the `name` parameter into the string using the `{}` placeholder.
- `fn main() {`: This is the `main` function, which is the entry point of your Rust program.
- `greet("MANTRA Developer");`: This line calls the `greet` function, passing the string "MANTRA Developer" as an argument for the `name` parameter.

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can also return values, just like mathematical functions.  To specify the return type, use an arrow (`->`) followed by the type:

```solidity
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b // The result of the addition is returned
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 3);
    println!("The sum is: {}", result); // Output: "The sum is: 8"
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two integers as input and returns their sum, which is then stored in the `result` variable and printed to the console.

 Let's break down this Rust code step-by-step:

**1. Function Definition (`add`):**

- `fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {`:
    - `fn`: This keyword signifies the start of a function definition.
    - `add`: This is the name of the function (choose a descriptive name that reflects its purpose).
    - `(a: i32, b: i32)`: This is the parameter list. It defines the inputs the function expects. In this case, it takes two parameters named `a` and `b`, both of the `i32` type (32-bit signed integers).
    - `-> i32`: This indicates the return type of the function. It specifies that the function will return a value of type `i32`.
    - `{` and `}`: These curly braces enclose the function's body, the code that will be executed when the function is called.
    - `a + b`: This line is the function's body. It performs the addition of the two input values (`a` and `b`).
    - Implicit Return: In Rust, you don't need an explicit `return` statement if the last expression in a function body is a value. Rust automatically returns this value as the function's result.

**2. Main Function (`main`):**

- `fn main() {`: This defines the `main` function, which is the starting point of your Rust program's execution.
- `let result = add(5, 3);`: This line does two things:
    - It calls the `add` function, passing the values 5 and 3 as arguments for the `a` and `b` parameters, respectively.
    - It stores the returned value from the `add` function (which is 8) in a new variable called `result`.
- `println!("The sum is: {}", result);`: This line prints the following to the console:
    
    `The sum is: 8`
    

### Inbuilt and User-Defined Functions: Rust's Power Tools

Rust comes equipped with a set of built-in functions (like `println!` and `format!`) that simplify common tasks. However, the true power of Rust lies in creating your own *user-defined* functions, tailoring them to your specific needs. These functions encapsulate reusable blocks of code, making your programs more organized and efficient.

User-defined functions let you name a specific action (like `calculate_balance` or `verify_ownership`), define what kind of input it needs (parameters), and specify what it should produce as a result (return value). Remember our `add` function from earlier? That's a simple example of a user-defined function. It takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

We'll dive deeper into creating and using functions as we build our to-do list dApp. This is just a taste of the power and flexibility that functions bring to Rust programming!

## Coding Challenge: Mastering Functions Through Geometry

Let's flex those Rust muscles and put your newfound knowledge of functions to work!  We're going to build a mini geometry calculator that can find the areas of different shapes. To make things interesting, we'll use each of these four ways to write functions

1. Function with a return value, but no input parameters.
2. Function with input parameters, but no return value.
3. Function with neither input parameters nor a return value.
4. Function with both input parameters and a return value.

Your task is to write a Rust program that calculates and displays the areas of:

- **Circle:** Given its radius.
- **Square:** Given its side length.
- **Rectangle:** Given its length and width.
- **Triangle:** Given its base and height.

You'll need to create a separate function for each shape, each adhering to one of the four function ways mentioned above.

**Let's Get Coding!**

Open your text editor or IDE and create a new Rust file (e.g., `area_of_shapes.rs`). Start by defining your functions, each following a different structure. Then, in your `main` function, call these functions with appropriate inputs to calculate and display the areas. Also don’t forget to update `main.rs` accordingly!

1. Add the function for calculating area of circle. This function will be of type: Function with Parameters and Return Type.

```solidity
fn area_of_circle(radius: f64) -> f64 {
    radius * radius * 3.14
}
```

1. **Function Definition (`area_of_circle`):**
    - `fn area_of_circle(radius: f64) -> f64 {`:
        - This line defines the function `area_of_circle`, which takes one parameter, `radius`, of type `f64` (double-precision floating-point number).
        - The `> f64` after the parameter list indicates that the function will return a value of type `f64`.
    - `radius * radius * 3.14`:
        - This is the function's body, where the calculation for the area of a circle is performed. It multiplies the radius by itself (squaring it) and then multiplies by the approximate value of pi (3.14).
2. Now lets call this function from main():

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    // Call the area_of_circle function
    let radius = 5.0;
    let circle_area = area_of_circle(radius);
    println!("Area of circle with radius {}: {}", radius, circle_area);
}
```

1. **Main Function (`main`):**
    - `let radius = 5.0;`: This line declares a variable `radius` and assigns it the value 5.0, representing the radius of the circle.
    - `let circle_area = area_of_circle(radius);`: This line calls the `area_of_circle` function, passing the value of `radius` as an argument. The function calculates the area and returns the result, which is then assigned to the variable `circle_area`.
    - `println!("Area of circle with radius {}: {}", radius, circle_area);`: This line prints a formatted message to the console, stating the radius of the circle and the calculated area. The `{}` placeholders are replaced by the values of the `radius` and `circle_area` variables, respectively.
        
        ![nft-mantra-c2 (17).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/5.%20Functions%20in%20Rust%20Your%20Code's%20Action%20Her/nft-mantra-c2_(17).webp?raw=true)
        
2. Add the function for calculating area of square. This function will be of type without parameters and without return type.

```solidity
// Function without parameters and without return type
fn area_of_square() {
    let side = 4;
    println!("Area of square: {}", side * side);
}
```

1. The `area_of_square` function calculates and prints the area of a square with a side length of 4. It does this without requiring any external input (no parameters) and without returning a value. 
2. The function first declares a variable `side` to store the side length, then calculates the area by squaring this value (`side * side`), and finally prints the result to the console using string interpolation. 
3. The absence of a return type (indicated by the empty parentheses after the function name) confirms that the function only performs an action (printing) and doesn't produce a value for further use.
4. Now call this function from main() by adding these lines after the existing code:

```solidity
 // Call the area_of_square function
    area_of_square();
```

![nft-mantra-c2 (18).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/5.%20Functions%20in%20Rust%20Your%20Code's%20Action%20Her/nft-mantra-c2_(18).webp?raw=true)

1. Add the function for calculating area of rectangle. This function will be of type with parameters and without return type.

```solidity
// Function with parameters, without return type
fn area_of_rectangle(length: i64, width: i64) {
    println!("Area of rectangle: {}", length * width);
}
```

1. This function takes two input parameters, `length` and `width` (both of type `i64`), representing the dimensions of a rectangle.
2. It calculates and directly prints the area of the rectangle to the console without returning any value.
3. Now call this function from main() by adding these lines after the existing code:

```solidity
// Call the area_of_rectangle function
    area_of_rectangle(10, 6);
```

![nft-mantra-c2 (19).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/5.%20Functions%20in%20Rust%20Your%20Code's%20Action%20Her/nft-mantra-c2_(19).webp?raw=true)

1. Finally, add the function for calculating area of triangle. This function will be of type without parameters and with return type.

```solidity
// Function without parameters and with return type
fn area_of_triangle() -> f64 {
    let length = 7.0; // Made these floats to match return type
    let base = 15.0;
    length * base * 0.5 
}
```

1. This function takes no input parameters, but it returns the area of a triangle as a `f64` floating-point value.
2. While the function doesn't take any input for customization, it internally defines fixed values for the length (7.0) and base (15.0). These values are used to calculate the area using the formula `0.5 * length * base`. The calculated area is then returned as a `f64` value.
3. Now call this function from main() by adding these lines after the existing code:

```solidity
    // Call the area_of_triangle function
    let triangle_area = area_of_triangle();
    println!("Area of triangle: {}", triangle_area);
```

1. The final code will be:

```solidity
// Function with parameters and with return type
fn area_of_circle(radius: f64) -> f64 {
    radius * radius * 3.14
}

// Function without parameters and without return type
fn area_of_square() {
    let side = 4;
    println!("Area of square: {}", side * side);
}

// Function with parameters, without return type
fn area_of_rectangle(length: i64, width: i64) {
    println!("Area of rectangle: {}", length * width);
}

// Function without parameters and with return type
fn area_of_triangle() -> f64 {
    let length = 7.0;
    let base = 15.0;
    length * base * 0.5 
}

fn main() {
    // Call the area_of_circle function
    let radius = 5.0;
    let circle_area = area_of_circle(radius);
    println!("Area of circle with radius {}: {}", 
    radius, circle_area);

    // Call the area_of_square function
    area_of_square();

    // Call the area_of_rectangle function
    area_of_rectangle(10, 6);

    // Call the area_of_triangle function
    let triangle_area = area_of_triangle();
    println!("Area of triangle: {}", triangle_area);
}

```
