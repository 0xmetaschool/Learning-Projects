# Data Types in Rust

Welcome back, Rust explorers! We've just scratched the surface of Rust's capabilities by getting acquainted with variables. Now, get ready to expand your toolbox with a deeper dive into Rust's data types. We'll explore how Rust handles numbers (integers, floats), text (characters), and other essential building blocks for your smart contracts. So, grab your coding gear and let's unlock the power of data in Rust!

## Need of Data Types

In the world of Rust, data types are the language your program uses to understand and manipulate information. Think of them as labels on boxes, telling Rust what's inside – whether it's numbers, text, or something more complex. What's cool is that Rust is smart enough to often figure out the type of data you're working with, even if you don't explicitly tell it. This is called *type inference*.

But why should we bother learning about data types if Rust is so clever?  Well, understanding data types is crucial for several reasons:

- **Logic and Reasoning:** Data types form the basis of how your program processes information. By understanding data types, you can reason about the flow of data, write more accurate logic, and avoid unexpected errors.
- **Language Understanding:** Data types are a fundamental part of Rust's syntax and semantics. Mastering them is essential for reading and writing Rust code effectively.
- **Function Input and Output:** Functions in Rust expect specific types of input and produce specific types of output. Understanding data types is crucial for defining functions correctly and ensuring they work as intended.
- **Contract State Management:** In the context of CosmWasm smart contracts, data types are used to define the structure of the data stored on the blockchain. This ensures that the data is consistent and can be manipulated safely.

So, even though Rust is smart, it's still important for us to be smart about data types. Let's dive in and explore the most common ones you'll encounter when building CosmWasm smart contracts!

## Deep dive into Data Types

Let’s take a look at some important data types in Rust.

### Integers (signed and unsigned): The Whole Numbers

Integers are used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative. Rust has several integer types to choose from, each with a different size and range of values they can hold.

### Signed Integers: The Plus and Minus Crew (The Default)

Signed integers, as the name suggests, can represent both positive and negative numbers. When you declare an integer in Rust without specifying otherwise, it will be a signed integer. Rust provides several signed integer types, each with a different size and range:

| **Type** | **Size(bits)** | **Range** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i8 | 8 | -128 to 127 |
| i16 | 16 | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| i32 | 32 | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| i64 | 64 | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

### Unsigned Integers: The Positive Posse

Unsigned integers can only represent non-negative numbers (zero and positive values). To use an unsigned integer, you need to explicitly specify its type with a `u` prefix. Rust offers several unsigned integer types:

| **Type** | **Size(bits)** | **Range** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| u8 | 8 | 0 to 255 |
| u16 | 16 | 0 to 65,535 |
| u32 | 32 | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| u64 | 64 | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |

**Let's Code!**

1. Let's create a new file inside the `src` folder with the name `datatypes.rs`.
2. Add these lines inside the `datatypes.rs` file:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let num_tasks: u32 = 10;         // Unsigned 32-bit integer for task count
    let my_token_balance: u64 = 100000000;  // Unsigned 128-bit integer for token balance
    let profit_or_loss: i64 = -500;  // Signed 64-bit integer for profit/loss
    let default_int: i32 = -5;       // Signed 32-bit integer (i32 is inferred)

    // Print the values to the console:
    println!("Number of tasks: {}", num_tasks);           
    println!("My token balance: {}", my_token_balance); 
    println!("Profit/loss: {}", profit_or_loss);         
    println!("Default integer: {}", default_int);      
}
```

3. Let's go back to our `main.rs` and import the `datatypes.rs` module. When you run `cargo run`, the Rust compiler will execute `main.rs`, not `datatypes.rs`. Therefore, you need to ensure that `datatypes.rs` is included as part of `main.rs`.
    
    ```jsx
    mod datatypes;
    
    fn main() {
        datatypes::main();
    }
    ```
    
4. Run the code using our usual command `cargo run`, or in VS code you can simple click on the Run button on top right corner to the run the code.

### Floating-Point Numbers: Handling Decimals in Rust

While integers are useful for representing whole numbers, floating-point numbers (or floats) are essential when you need to work with decimal values. Rust has two main types of floats: `f32` (single-precision) and `f64` (double-precision).

`f32` floats are smaller and faster to process but have less precision compared to `f64` floats, which offer more accuracy when dealing with decimal values. By default, Rust uses `f64` for floating-point numbers.

Floating-point numbers are widely used in financial applications like:

- **Token Prices:** Representing the price of a token in another currency (e.g., the price of OM in USD).
- **Interest Rates:** Calculating interest on loans or deposits.
- **Financial Calculations:** Performing complex calculations involving decimals.

**Let’s code**

1. Remove the previous code and add this code in `datatypes.rs` file.

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let token_price: f64 = 23.55431273273917;        
    let token_price1: f32 = 23.55431273273917;         
    println!("f64 token price= {}", token_price);
    println!("f32 token price= {}", token_price1);
}
```

2. Run the code, you will get such an output:

```solidity
f64 token price= 23.55431273273917
f32 token price= 23.554314
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

![nft-mantra-c2 (2).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/2.%20Data%20Types%20in%20Rust/nft-mantra-c2_(2).webp?raw=true)

3. **`token_price: f64`:** This declares a variable `token_price` as a double-precision float and assigns it a decimal value.
4. **`token_price1: f32`:** This declares a variable `token_price1` as a single-precision float and assigns it the same decimal value.

The `println!` statements then output the values of these variables.  Since `f64` has a higher precision, it will preserve more decimal places than `f32`, leading to a slightly different output for each variable.

This example showcases the importance of choosing the appropriate floating-point type based on the level of precision required for your calculations.

**Key Takeaway:** When high precision is crucial, especially in financial calculations, it's often advisable to use `f64` for its greater accuracy. However, `f32` can be used for scenarios where memory efficiency is a priority and slight precision loss is acceptable.

### Booleans: Rust's Truth Detectors

Booleans are the simplest of all data types in Rust. They can only have one of two values:

- `true` (representing "yes", "on", or "1")
- `false` (representing "no", "off", or "0")

Booleans are the backbone of logical operations and decision-making in your code. They allow you to create conditional statements and control the flow of your program based on whether certain conditions are met.

**Let’s see an example:**

1. Remove the previous code and add the below code in `datatypes.rs` (or you can create a new file, your choice🤓)

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let is_rust_fun: bool = true; // Obviously!
    println!("Is Rust fun? {}", is_rust_fun);
}
```

2. Run your code and you should see:

```solidity
Is Rust fun? true
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

![nft-mantra-c2 (3).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/2.%20Data%20Types%20in%20Rust/nft-mantra-c2_(3).webp?raw=true)

In your CosmWasm smart contracts, booleans will be crucial for implementing logic and decision-making. For example, you might use a boolean to track whether a transaction has been approved, a user is authorized, or a certain condition has been met.

Now that you've mastered booleans, you're well on your way to building more sophisticated and interactive dApps on MANTRA Chain!

### Characters: Rust's Alphabet, Beyond Just Letters

In Rust, the `char` data type is your toolbox for representing individual units of text. This means not only the letters you're used to (a, b, c, etc.) but also numbers, punctuation marks, and even symbols from different writing systems worldwide.

```solidity
let letter_m: char = 'M';       // An uppercase letter
let digit_1: char = '1';       // A number
let exclamation: char = '!';    // Punctuation
let chinese_character: char = '好'; // A character from another language
```

Notice how each character is enclosed in single quotes? That's how Rust knows you're talking about a single character, not a whole word or phrase.

**Let's Code!**

Remove the previous code and add the below code to your `datatype.rs` file and print them to the console:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let letter_a: char = 'a';
    let number_4: char = '4';
    let symbol_at: char = '@';
    println!("Letter: {}", letter_a);
    println!("Number: {}", number_4);
    println!("Symbol: {}", symbol_at);
}
```

Run your code and you should see:

```solidity
Letter: a
Number: 4
Symbol: @
```
Here's the screenshot of the output.

![nft-mantra-c2 (4).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/2.%20Data%20Types%20in%20Rust/nft-mantra-c2_(4).webp?raw=true)

Characters are the fundamental building blocks of text in Rust. They're not just letters, but any single symbol you can type on your keyboard (or beyond!). While you might work with longer pieces of text (strings) more often in your CosmWasm contracts, understanding how Rust handles individual characters is key for manipulating and processing textual data.
