# Lesson 8: Operators in Rust: Unleashing Your Inner Mathematician (and Logician!)

Alright, MANTRA devs, buckle up because we're about to add some serious firepower to your coding arsenal! In the previous lesson, we explored the fundamental building blocks of data: integers, floats, booleans, and characters. Now, get ready to manipulate, transform, and combine these data types using Rust's powerful operators.

Think of operators as the verbs of the Rust language. They're the action words that tell your code what to *do* with your data. Want to add two numbers together? Check if a value is greater than another?  Flip the state of a boolean? Operators are your go-to tools.

## **Types of Operators: A Toolbox for Data Manipulation**

Rust offers a wide range of operators, but we'll focus on the ones most relevant for your CosmWasm journey:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:** For performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Comparison Operators:** For comparing values and checking if they're equal, greater than, or less than each other.
3. **Logical Operators:** For combining boolean values (true/false) and creating complex logical expressions.
4. **Bitwise Operators:** For manipulating individual bits within integer values (we'll get to this in a later lesson).
5. **Assignment Operators:** For assigning values to variables.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators in Rust are the essential tools for performing basic mathematical calculations in your code. They work just like you learned in elementary school math class! Here's a quick rundown:

- `+` (Addition): Combines two values by adding them together.
- `-` (Subtraction): Finds the difference between two values.
- `*`(Multiplication): Calculates the product of two values.
- `/` (Division): Determines how many times one value fits into another.
- `%` (Modulo): Finds the remainder after division.

**Letâ€™s see a coding example**

1. Create a new file in `src` folder with the name `operators.rs` 
2. Add the following code to the file:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let apples = 10;
    let oranges = 5;

    let total_fruit = apples + oranges;
    let remaining_apples = apples - oranges;
    let total_slices = apples * 4;
    let slices_per_person = total_slices / 2;
    let leftover_slices = total_slices % 3;

    println!("Total fruit: {}", total_fruit);
    println!("Remaining apples: {}", remaining_apples);
    println!("Total slices: {}", total_slices);
    println!("Slices per person: {}", slices_per_person);
    println!("Leftover slices: {}", leftover_slices);
}

```

1. Let's again go back to our `main.rs` and import the `operators.rs` module. This time we will comment out `datatypes.rs` as we are currently working on operators.
    
    ```jsx
    // mod datatypes; //we will comment out datatypes.rs as we are currently not using it in our code
    mod operators;
    
    fn main() {
        // datatypes::main(); // same goes for this line
        operators::main();
    }
    ```

I think the code is simple enough, and you are smart enough, so moving ahead.

These operators work with various numeric data types (integers and floats). Just like in regular math, make sure the types of values you're operating on are compatible for the calculations.

With these operators, you can perform essential arithmetic operations within your CosmWasm smart contracts, such as calculating token balances, determining exchange rates, or even tracking the score of a game!

### Comparison Operators

In Rust, comparison operators are the judges of your code, determining whether one value is bigger, smaller, or equal to another. They're like referees in a sports match, making crucial decisions based on the rules of the game.

Here's a quick rundown of Rust's comparison operators:

- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

These operators work with various data types, including numbers, characters, and even some custom types you might create in your smart contracts. Let's see how they work in action, remove the previous code and add this:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 5;

    let is_equal = x == y;
    let is_not_equal = x != y;
    let is_greater = x > y;
    let is_less = x < y;
    let is_greater_or_equal = x >= y;
    let is_less_or_equal = x <= y;

    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
    println!("Is x equal to y? {}", is_equal);
    println!("Is x not equal to y? {}", is_not_equal);
    println!("Is x greater than y? {}", is_greater);
    println!("Is x less than y? {}", is_less);
    println!("Is x greater than or equal to y? {}", is_greater_or_equal);
    println!("Is x less than or equal to y? {}", is_less_or_equal);
}
```

Again, simple enough to understand correct?

When you run this code the output will be:

```solidity
x: 10, y: 5
Is x equal to y? false
Is x not equal to y? true
Is x greater than y? true
Is x less than y? false
Is x greater than or equal to y? true
Is x less than or equal to y? false
```

This clearly shows the results of each comparison operation, demonstrating how you can use comparison operators in Rust to make decisions based on the relationships between values.

### Logical Operators

In Rust, logical operators are like the "and," "or," and "not" words in your mental decision-making process. They allow you to combine boolean values (`true` or `false`) to create more complex logical expressions.  Let's see how they work:

1. **Logical AND (`&&`)**:
    - This operator is like a strict bouncer at a club. It only lets you in if you meet *all* the criteria (both conditions are `true`).
    - For example: `true && true` evaluates to `true`, but `true && false` evaluates to `false`.
2. **Logical OR (`||`)**:
    - This operator is more relaxed. It lets you in if you meet *at least one* of the criteria (either condition is `true`).
    - For example: `true || false` evaluates to `true`, and `false || false` evaluates to `false`.
3. **Logical NOT (`!`)**:
    - This operator is a rebel. It simply flips the truth value of a boolean expression.
    - For example: `!true` is `false`, and `!false` is `true`.

**Code Example: Logical Playground**

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let is_sunny = true;
    let water_is_warm = false;
    let no_sharks = true;

    let should_go_swimming = is_sunny && water_is_warm && no_sharks;
    let is_safe_to_swim = water_is_warm || no_sharks;
    let is_sunny_but_not_warm = is_sunny && !water_is_warm;

    println!("Should I go swimming? {}", should_go_swimming);        // false
    println!("Is it safe to swim? {}", is_safe_to_swim);             // true
    println!("Is it sunny but not warm? {}", is_sunny_but_not_warm);  // true
}

```

In this example, we combine our boolean variables (`is_sunny`, `water_is_warm`, `no_sharks`) using logical operators to determine if we should go swimming or if it's safe to swim. The `println!` statements display the results of these logical expressions.

**Key Points:**

- Logical operators help you create complex conditions and make decisions in your code.
- They work with boolean values (`true` or `false`).
- Short-circuiting: In Rust, `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting operators. This means that if the left operand of `&&` is false, or the left operand of `||` is true, the right operand will not be evaluated, as the overall result is already determined.

By mastering logical operators, you'll be able to build smart contracts that can evaluate complex conditions and make intelligent decisions based on the state of the blockchain.

### Assignment Operators

In Rust, we've already seen the basic assignment operator `=`, which is like putting a value into a box (a variable). But Rust offers some handy shortcuts for common operations, known as compound assignment operators.

These operators combine arithmetic or bitwise operations with assignment, making your code more concise. Let's take a look:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| += | Add and assign | x = x + 5 |
| -= | Subtract and assign | x = x - 3 |
| *= | Multiply and assign | x = x * 2 |
| /= | Divide and assign | x = x / 4 |
| %= | Modulo and assign | x = x % 7 |

**Coding example:**

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let mut x = 10;
    x += 5;    // x is now 15 
    println!("x after adding 5: {}", x);
    x -= 3;    // x is now 12
    println!("x after subtracting 3: {}", x);
    x *= 2;    // x is now 24
    println!("x after multiplying by 2: {}", x);
    x /= 6;    // x is now 4
    println!("x after dividing by 6: {}", x);
    x %= 3;    // x is now 1
    println!("x after modulo 3: {}", x);
}
```
