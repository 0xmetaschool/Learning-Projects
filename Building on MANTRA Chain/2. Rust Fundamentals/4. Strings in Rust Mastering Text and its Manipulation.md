# Strings in Rust: Mastering Text and its Manipulation

Hey there, MANTRA coders! 

Ready to take your Rust skills to the next level? In our previous lesson, we tackled the operators in Rust. Now, let's dive deeper into the world of text manipulation with strings! We'll explore how to create, modify, and combine strings, giving you the power to handle textual data in your smart contracts with ease. Let’s get started!!

## Strings in Rust: Words, Phrases, and More

In the world of programming, we often need to work with text data – names, descriptions, addresses, and even entire documents. Rust provides two primary types for handling text: `String` and `&str`. Let's dive into their differences and how to use them effectively in your CosmWasm contracts.

**String: The Flexible Wordsmith**

In Rust, a `String` is a flexible way to store and manipulate text. It's like a blank document where you can add, remove, or change the words as needed.

But here's the twist: you need to tell Rust if you want that flexibility. If you don't want the text to change, just declare the string as usual. But if you might want to edit it later, add the magic word `mut` before the variable name. This gives you the power to change the string's contents whenever you like!

**Let’s code**

First, create a new file with the name `stringtutorial.rs` inside the `src` folder.

To create a `String`, you typically use the `from` function:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let mut mutable_greeting = String::from("Hello"); 
    mutable_greeting.push_str(", MANTRA Chain!"); // Add to the string
    println!("{}", mutable_greeting); // Output: "Hello, MANTRA Chain!"
}
```

Here, we start with "Hello" and then use the `push_str` function to append more text, creating a longer greeting. The `.push_str()` function is specifically designed to add a string slice to the end of an existing `String`.

Now go back to our `main.rs` and import the `stringtutorial.rs` module. 

```jsx
// mod datatypes;
// mod operators;
mod stringtutorial;

fn main() {
    // datatypes::main();
    // operators::main();
    stringtutorial::main();
}
```

If we do not add `mut` keyword you will get following error:

![nft-mantra-c2 (10).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/4.%20Strings%20in%20Rust%20Mastering%20Text%20and%20its%20Ma/nft-mantra-c2_(10).webp?raw=true)

**&str: The Speedy Reference**

Think of a `&str` (pronounced "string slice") as a snapshot of a piece of text. It's a reference to a sequence of characters, often stored directly in your program's code or in a `String`. String slices are immutable, meaning you can't change the text they refer to, but they're super-fast to work with because they don't involve copying data.

If you've dabbled in languages like C or C++, you might find this concept familiar.  A `&str` is essentially Rust's version of a pointer to a string. Just like a pointer, a `&str` holds the memory address of where the actual text data begins, along with information about how long the string is.  However, unlike raw pointers in C/C++, Rust's references come with built-in safety guarantees, preventing you from accidentally accessing invalid memory locations or causing other nasty bugs.

Let's see how this works in code:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let my_slice: &str = "This is a string slice!";
    println!("{}", my_slice);
}
```

Run it, and you will get an output:

```solidity
This is a string slice!
```

Now, try to change it, it will not work.

```solidity
pub fn main() {
		let my_slice: &str = "This is a string slice!";
		my_slice.push_str("More text"); // Try to add this line, it will not work
		println!("{}", my_slice);
}
```

Remember we cannot change the string they refer to, but we can always make them refer to a completely new string (provided you have used `mut` keyword). 

Remove the previous code and add the following code:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let mut my_slice: &str = "This is a string slice!";
    println!("{}", my_slice);
    my_slice = "Update value is string slice 2";
    println!("After change: {}", my_slice);
}
```

Again we cannot change the value of original string &str was pointing to, but we can change where it is pointing to, if the variable is declared using `mut` keyword.

This distinction is important for understanding how string slices work in Rust. You'll often use them for efficiency when you only need to read or reference text without the need for modification.  If you do need to modify text, you'll typically use the `String` type instead.

## String Manipulation and Operations in Rust

Alright, you've mastered the fundamentals of strings in Rust.  Now, let's turn up the dial and unleash your inner wordsmith! In this section, we'll explore some essential techniques for manipulating and working with strings, giving you the skills to craft dynamic, expressive, and informative text within your CosmWasm smart contracts.

**Building and Combining Strings**

We already learned how to create strings using the `from` method in Rust:

```solidity
let my_string = String::from("Hello");
```

However, that is not the only way! Here are some common ways to create and combine strings:

- **The `format!` Macro:** This powerful tool allows you to insert variables and other values directly into your strings:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    let message = format!("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.", name, age);
    println!("{}", message); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
}
```

- **Concatenation (`+` operator):** For `String` types, you can concatenate (join) them together using the `+` operator.  The `+` operator for string concatenation expects a `&str` on the right-hand side. By using `&`, we create a reference to the `last_name` variable, effectively borrowing its value as a `&str` without having to create a new `String`. This avoids unnecessary copying of data and is more efficient.

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let first_name = String::from("Alice");
    let last_name = String::from("Johnson");
    let full_name = first_name + " " + &last_name;
    println!("{}", full_name); // Output: "Alice Johnson"
}
```

**String Operations:**

- **Length:**  Find out how long a string is using `.len()`:

```solidity
pub fn main() {
    let my_string = "Hello, MANTRA Chain!";
    let length = my_string.len();
    println!("The length of the string is: {}", length); //Output: "The length of the string is: 20"
}
```

- **Indexing:**
    - Access individual characters within a string using indexing. Remember, indexing starts at 0 in Rust. Each character in the string has a corresponding position, or index, starting from zero.  So, the first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
    - Rust strings are a bit more nuanced than in some other languages. They're not just simple arrays of characters, but rather a sequence of bytes encoded in UTF-8 .Each character in string might not necessarily be represented by a single byte, so we'll use the `.chars()` method to iterate over the characters correctly.
    
    Let's see how this works in code:
    
    ```solidity
    pub fn main() {
        let message = "Hello, MANTRA Chain!";
        let first_char = message.chars().nth(0).unwrap(); // Get the first character 'H'
        println!("The first character is: {}", first_char); // Outputs: 'H'
    
        let last_char = message.chars().nth(message.chars().count() - 1).unwrap(); // Get the last character '!'
        println!("The last character is: {}", last_char); // Outputs: '!'
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, `.chars()` creates an iterator that allows us to walk through the string character by character. The `nth(0)` method then retrieves the first character in the iterator, which is the letter 'H'.
    
    Similarly, `.chars().count()` finds total characters in the string, minus 1 to get last character.
    
    We use `.unwrap()` to get the character value assuming the index is valid. In a real-world senario, you'd want to handle the case where the index is invalid to prevent your program from panicking.
    
    ![nft-mantra-c2 (15).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/4.%20Strings%20in%20Rust%20Mastering%20Text%20and%20its%20Ma/nft-mantra-c2_(15).webp?raw=true)
    
    With this understanding of indexing, you can now precisely pinpoint individual characters within your strings. This will come in handy when you need to extract specific pieces of information or manipulate text in your CosmWasm smart contracts.
    
- **Slicing:**
    - Slicing in Rust is like using a pair of scissors to cut out a specific section of a string. It's a handy tool for extracting substrings, which are smaller portions of your original text. You can think of it as selecting a specific range of characters from a sentence or paragraph.
    - In Rust, we use square brackets `[]` and a range notation to specify the start and end indices of the slice we want to extract. The syntax looks like this:
    
    ```solidity
    &my_string[start..end]
    ```
    
    - Here, `start` is the index of the first character you want to include in the slice, and `end` is the index of the character *after* the last one you want to include. Remember, Rust's indexing starts at zero!
    
    **Let's see some slicing examples in action:**
    
    ```solidity
    pub fn main() {
        let message = "Hello, MANTRA Chain!";
    
        let hello_slice = &message[0..5];       // Extract "Hello"
        println!("{}", hello_slice);          // Output: Hello
    
        let mantra_slice = &message[7..13];     // Extract "MANTRA"
        println!("{}", mantra_slice);           // Output: MANTRA
    
        let chain_slice = &message[14..];        // Extract "Chain!"
        println!("{}", chain_slice);            // Output: Chain!
    
        let whole_string_slice = &message[..]; // Extract the entire string
        println!("{}", whole_string_slice);   // Output: Hello, MANTRA Chain!
    }
    ```
    
    ![nft-mantra-c2 (16).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/2.%20Rust%20Fundamentals/4.%20Strings%20in%20Rust%20Mastering%20Text%20and%20its%20Ma/nft-mantra-c2_(16).webp?raw=true)
    
    Let's break this down:
    
    1. We start with a string variable named message, containing the text "Hello, MANTRA Chain!".
    2. We then create several string slices:
        - `hello_slice` extracts the characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 5, resulting in the string "Hello".
        - `mantra_slice` extracts the characters from index 7 up to (but not including) index 13, resulting in the string "MANTRA".
        - `chain_slice` extracts the characters from index 14 to the end of the string, resulting in the string "Chain!".
        - `whole_string_slice` extracts the entire string from the beginning (index 0) to the end.
    3. Finally, we print each of these slices to the console, demonstrating how we've successfully extracted different portions of the original string.
