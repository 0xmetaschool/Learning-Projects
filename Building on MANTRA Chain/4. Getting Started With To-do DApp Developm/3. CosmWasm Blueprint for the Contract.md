# Lesson 18: CosmWasm Blueprint for the Contract

Welcome back, MANTRA coders! get ready to dive into the heart of our decentralized application! In this lesson, we'll unlock the secrets of building a robust and scalable smart contract using CosmWasm. We'll explore the essential components and files that make up our contract's foundation, and discover how they work together in harmony to bring our decentralized vision to life.

Don't worry if some of this feels a bit intimidating at first. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither are complex dApps. We'll take it step-by-step, starting with the basics and gradually building up to more sophisticated concepts. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of the core elements of a CosmWasm contract and be ready to start coding your own decentralized masterpiece!

## The Blueprint of Your dApp: Understanding the CosmWasm Contract Structure

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of coding our to-do list dApp, let's take a moment to map out the blueprint. Just like a well-organized construction project, a CosmWasm smart contract has a specific structure that helps you keep your code clean, organized, and maintainable. This structure is typically spread across five essential files:

1. `contract.rs`: This is the heart and soul of your smart contract. It's where you define the core logic of your dApp, including the functions that handle messages and queries, and the actions that modify the contract's state. Think of it as the brains of the operation, orchestrating all the behind-the-scenes magic.
2. `error.rs`: Errors are bound to happen in the complex world of code. This file is your contract's error handling manual. It defines custom error types to categorize and handle different exceptions that might occur during execution, providing valuable feedback to users and developers.
3. `msg.rs`: Communication is key, even for smart contracts! This file acts as the contract's communication interface, defining the structure of messages that can be sent to the contract (like commands to add or delete a task) and the responses it sends back.
4. `lib.rs`: This is the main entry point of your contract. Think of it as the front door, welcoming users and directing them to the appropriate parts of your dApp. It typically handles imports, declares modules, and exposes the necessary functions for external interaction.
5. `state.rs`: This file is your contract's memory bank. It defines the data structures that represent the state of your dApp. In our to-do list example, this would include information about each task, such as its description, status, and priority.

This modular structure might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but trust us, it's your secret weapon for building robust, maintainable, and scalable dApps. As we start coding our to-do list contract, you'll see how each of these files plays a crucial role in bringing your vision to life. We have already created these files(empty for now) for you in the project’s `src` folder.

## What's in [state.rs](http://state.rs/)?

Before we write a single line of code, let's think about how our to-do list will work and what kind of information it needs to remember:

- **Individual Tasks:** Each task needs a description, a status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"), and perhaps a priority level.
- **Task Identification:** We need a way to uniquely identify each task.
- **Task List:** We need to store a collection of tasks.

How do we represent this in Rust code? The answer is structs and enums! 

- **`Entry` Struct:** This struct will be our blueprint for individual to-do items. It will contain fields for:
    - `id`: A unique identifier (a number) for each task.
    - `description`: The task's description (a string of text).
    - `status`: The task's current status (an enum).
    - `priority`: The task's priority level (another enum).
    - `owner`: The owner of the to-do item (a string address).
- **`Status` and `Priority` Enums:** These enums will define the possible values for the `status` and `priority` fields of the `Entry` struct.
- **`LIST`:** This will be a map (a data structure that associates keys with values) to store our to-do items. We'll use the task's `id` as the key and the `Entry` struct itself as the value.
- **`ENTRY_SEQ`:** This will be a variable to help us generate unique IDs for each new task.
- **Dependencies**: We've already added the necessary dependencies in our `Cargo.toml` file. These dependencies include:
    - `cosmwasm_std`: The CosmWasm standard library, which provides essential tools and types for smart contract development.
    - `cosmwasm_schema`: A library for generating JSON schemas from Rust types, used for serialization/deserialization with CosmWasm.
    - `cw_storage_plus`: A library for working with persistent storage in CosmWasm contracts.
    

### Code in state.rs

Now that we know what will be added in state.rs, let’s see the code.

1. In [`state.rs`](http://state.rs) file start by importing the required files.

```rust
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;
use cw_storage_plus::{Item, Map};
```

- `use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;`: Import the `cw_serde` macro from the `cosmwasm_schema` crate(library/package). This macro is used to make our structs and enums compatible with CosmWasm's serialization and deserialization mechanism.
- `use cw_storage_plus::{Item, Map};`: Import the `Item` and `Map` types from the `cw_storage_plus` crate. These are essential for interacting with the contract's storage.

1. Now let’s create the `struct Entry`.

```rust

#[cw_serde]
pub struct Entry {
    pub id: u64,
    pub description: String,
    pub status: Status,
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub owner: String,
}
```

- `#[cw_serde]`: This attribute makes the `Entry`, `Status`, and `Priority` types serializable and deserializable.
- `pub struct Entry { ... }`: This defines our `Entry` struct with the fields we discussed earlier (`id`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `owner`). The `pub` keyword makes these fields publicly accessible.

1. Creating `Status` and `Priority` enums.

```rust
#[cw_serde]
pub enum Status {
    ToDo,
    InProgress,
    Done,
    Cancelled,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum Priority {
    None,
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
}
```

- `pub enum Status { ... }`: This defines the `Status` enum with four variants representing the possible states of a task (`ToDo`, `InProgress`, `Done`, `Cancelled`).
- `pub enum Priority { ... }`: This defines the `Priority` enum with four variants representing the possible priority levels (`None`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`).

1. Finally, let’s create out `LIST` and `ENTRY_SEQ`.

```rust
pub const ENTRY_SEQ: Item<u64> = Item::new("entry_seq");
pub const LIST: Map<u64, Entry> = Map::new("list");
```

- `pub const ENTRY_SEQ: Item<u64> = Item::new("entry_seq");`: This creates a persistent storage item named "entry_seq" that will hold a `u64` value. We'll use this to keep track of the next available ID for a new task.
- `pub const LIST: Map<u64, Entry> = Map::new("list");`: This creates a persistent storage map named "list." The keys will be task IDs (`u64`), and the values will be `Entry` structs representing the tasks themselves.
- An `Item` in `cw_storage_plus` is a container for storing a single value of a specific type. It's like a dedicated shelf in your closet for storing one specific item, like a pair of shoes. You can use `Item` to store things like:
    - Configuration settings for your contract (e.g., the owner's address)
    - Counters or sequences (e.g., the next available ID for a task)
    - Any other single piece of data that your contract needs to remember
- A `Map` in `cw_storage_plus` is like a dictionary or a hash table. It allows you to store multiple values, each associated with a unique key.  Think of it like a set of labeled drawers, where each drawer contains a specific type of item. You can use `Map` to store things like:
    - Lists of items (e.g., a list of to-do tasks, each identified by its ID)
    - User data (e.g., mapping user addresses to their balances)
    - Any other data where you need to quickly look up values based on a key

With the `state.rs` file as our foundation, we're ready to move on to the heart of our to-do list contract—defining the messages it will understand. This is where your dApp starts to take shape, laying out the communication channels for interaction with the outside world.

## Wrap Up

Alright! We've just laid the groundwork for our to-do list dApp by understanding the blueprint of a CosmWasm smart contract and diving into the `state.rs` file. We've defined our data structures, set up storage mechanisms, and essentially created the "brain" for our dApp to remember and manage tasks.

In the next lesson, we'll shift our focus to the contract's communication channels. We'll explore `msg.rs`, `lib.rs`, and `error.rs`, understanding how they define the messages our contract will receive, the core logic it will execute, and how it will handle any unexpected situations. Get ready to breathe life into your to-do list dApp as we continue building it together!
