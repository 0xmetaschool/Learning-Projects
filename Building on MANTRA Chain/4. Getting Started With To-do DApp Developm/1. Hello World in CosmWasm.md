# Hello World in CosmWasm

Welcome back people! In this lesson, we'll learn to compile, optimize and deploy a *Hello World* smart contract on the MANTRA testnet. We'll cover essential steps like updating configurations, optimizing our contract for minimal gas costs, and uploading our code to the blockchain. Plus, We'll instantiate our contract and interact with it to see our message stored in the contract's storage. So let’s not waste any more time and get our Smart contract onto the Mantra Dukong Testnet.

## **Project Files & Setup**

We've prepared a simple Hello World smart contract for you to use throughout this tutorial. To access the project files, please fork the repository using the following command:

```bash
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/building-on-MANTRA-chain.git --clone 
cd building-on-MANTRA-chain
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

⚠️ **Important Note**: After cloning the repository, you'll find a template `mantrachaind-cli.env` file. Instead of using this template directly, you should:

1. Open your own `mantrachaind-cli.env` file from Lesson 5
2. Copy its contents
3. Paste these contents to replace everything in the template file

**Critical Check**: This ensures that your environment variables, particularly:
- The `NODE` configuration
- The `TXFLAG` parameters

match exactly with your system-specific settings from Lesson 5.

To activate these settings, source the environment file in your terminal:
```bash
source mantrachaind-cli.env
```

Your project structure would as shown below

Alright then, Let’s compile our smart by running the following command.

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

![16.2.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/4.%20Getting%20Started%20With%20To-do%20DApp%20Developm/1.%20Hello%20World%20in%20CosmWasm/16.2.webp?raw=true)

Once the compilation is completed, you will be able to see the newly generated `hello_world.wasm` at `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory. This is the file we will deploying to testnet, but first we need to optimize it. 

## Optimizing our Contract

When it comes to smart contracts, smaller is better. The smaller your contract's binary size, the less you'll pay in gas costs. And who doesn't love saving money? Luckily, there's a tool that can help you shrink your contract's size without sacrificing performance.

### Rust-Optimizer

We will be using the [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) tool to optimize our production code. This tool produces reproducible builds of CosmWasm smart contracts, enabling third-party verification of the contract's authenticity. 

⚠️ Just make sure you've got Docker up and running on your machine before you get started. Run the following command to optimize our code.

Run one of the following commands based on your system to optimize the code:

### For Linux and Windows WSL Users:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

### For Mac Users:

- **Intel-based Mac**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
      --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
      --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
      cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
    ```
    
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac**:
    
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
      --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
      --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
      cosmwasm/optimizer-arm64:0.16.0
    ```
    

Once you run the optimizer, you will find the `hello_world.wasm` file for your smart contract deployment under `/artifacts`.

### Note for Windows WSL Users

If you are using Windows, follow these steps to ensure Docker works properly with WSL:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. From the **General** tab, select **Use WSL 2 based engine**
    - If you have installed Docker Desktop on a system that supports WSL 2, this option is turned on by default
4. Select **Apply & Restart**

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure Docker is running before executing the command
- Ensure you're in the correct directory containing your smart contract code
- For Windows WSL users, make sure WSL 2 is properly configured and Docker Desktop is set to use the WSL 2 based engine

Now before we go in and deploy our smart contract, if you want to see the list of codes that was uploaded to the network previously then run the following command to do so.

```bash
mantrachaind query wasm list-code $NODE
```

## Deploying the Contract

Run the following command to upload your wasm binary to the network and store the response in the `RES` variable. This response will contain the unique Code ID of your uploaded binary.

Note : If you have funded the wallet named under ‘wallet2’ then do specify “wallet2” instead of “wallet” in the following commands. 

```bash
RES=$(mantrachaind tx wasm store artifacts/hello_world.wasm --from wallet $TXFLAG -y --output json)
echo $RES
```

Next, use the `RES` variable to request the transaction hash, stored as `TX_HASH`. With this hash, you can then fetch the full transaction details, including events, and extract the `CODE_ID` from the response.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(echo $RES | jq -r .txhash)
CODE_ID=$(mantrachaind query tx $TX_HASH $NODE -o json | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

![16.4.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/4.%20Getting%20Started%20With%20To-do%20DApp%20Developm/1.%20Hello%20World%20in%20CosmWasm/16.4.webp?raw=true)

You can see the list of contracts instantiated using the particular Code Id using `mantrachaind` we had already setup and running the following command : 

```bash
mantrachaind query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json
```

The response will be an empty list as shown below, This is because we have not instantiated any contract yet.

```bash
{"contracts":[],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"0"}}
```

Before instantiating a contract, let's verify that the code stored on the blockchain matches the `hello_world.wasm` binary we uploaded. We'll use the `diff` command to compare the contents of two files:

- `artifacts/hello_world.wasm` (our original binary)
- `download.wasm` (the binary retrieved from the blockchain)

The `diff` command will display any differences between the two files, ensuring that the uploaded code is correct.

```bash
mantrachaind query wasm code $CODE_ID $NODE download.wasm
diff artifacts/hello_world.wasm download.wasm
```

## Instantiating the Contract

To instantiate our *Hello World* Smart Contract, we'll use the following command, passing arguments as a JSON object, along with our `CODE_ID`, `wallet`, `label`, and transaction flag `TXFLAG` :

```bash
mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"message":"Hello, World!"}' --from wallet --label "hello_world" $TXFLAG -y --no-admin
```

Note : Do replace `wallet` with `wallet2` in case you’ve funded `wallet2`.

Once the process completes, We can fetch the contract details using `mantrachaind` and store it inside `CONTRACT` for interaction.

```bash
CONTRACT=$(mantrachaind query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')
echo $CONTRACT
```

![16.5.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/4.%20Getting%20Started%20With%20To-do%20DApp%20Developm/1.%20Hello%20World%20in%20CosmWasm/16.5.webp?raw=true)

We can see the contract details like label, creator , block and code id by running the following command:

```bash
mantrachaind query wasm contract $CONTRACT $NODE
```

Upon instantiation, The `*hello_world*` contract will store the instantiation message data in the contract's storage, In order to view it we will query the entire contract state and use your corresponding value ( base64-encoded JSON object ) to decode the  base64-encoded string using the `base64 -d` command.

```bash
mantrachaind query wasm contract-state all $CONTRACT $NODE
```

Copy down the value string and replace in it the following before running it.

```bash
echo "<value-string>" | base64 -d
```

![16.6.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/4.%20Getting%20Started%20With%20To-do%20DApp%20Developm/1.%20Hello%20World%20in%20CosmWasm/16.6.webp?raw=true)

And there you have it! You can now see the initial message "Hello, World!" stored within your Hello World Smart Contract on the MANTRA Testnet. This marks a significant milestone - your contract is now live and storing data on the blockchain!

## **That's a Wrap!**

Congratulations, you've successfully uploaded, optimized, and instantiated your first smart contract on the MANTRA testnet! You've also verified that the initial message has been stored correctly.

In the next lesson, we'll start building a real-world application - a Todo App! We'll explore the logic and how to interact with our smart contract. Get ready to take your blockchain development skills to the next level!
