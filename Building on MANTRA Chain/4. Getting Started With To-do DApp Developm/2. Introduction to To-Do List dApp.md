# Introduction to To-Do List dApp

Hey Guys, in this lesson, we'll dive into the features and functionalities of our To-Do List dApp and discuss how we will be proceeding from now onwards on how to bring our dApp to life!

## The To-Do List dApp

Our To-Do List dApp is similar to Google Keep or Trello, but with a key difference - it's a decentralized application that empowers users to create, manage, and mark tasks as completed, all while maintaining full control over their data. Built on the secure and transparent Mantra Chain, our dApp offers a simple yet powerful tool for organizing your daily tasks, with the added benefits of blockchain technology.

## Features of our To-Do List dApp

- **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks with descriptions and priorities
- **Task Management:** Edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- **Decentralized Storage:** Tasks are stored securely on the Mantra Chain
- **User Authentication:** Only the owner can create, update, and delete their own tasks

## Functionality Overview

As previously discussed, our contract will also be having three entry points, enabling our To-Do List dApp to perform the following key functions:

- **Instantiate:** Initializes the contract by designating an owner
- **Execute:** Facilitates task management through three sub-functions:
    - **NewEntry:** Adds a new task with a description and priority
    - **UpdateEntry:** Modifies an existing task's description, status, and priority
    - **DeleteEntry:** Removes a task by its unique ID
- **Query:** Enables task retrieval through two sub-functions:
    - **QueryEntry:** Fetches a specific task by its ID
    - **QueryList:** Retrieves a paginated list of tasks

## Course Structure

In this course, we'll be building our To-Do List dApp from scratch. We'll cover the following topics:

- **CosmWasm Basics for the Contract** -
- **Adding To-Do Items** - Implementing the `NewEntry` functionality
- **Working with Vectors in CosmWasm** - Understanding how to work with vectors in Rust and CosmWasm
- **Implementing functions, Contract Management & Event Handling** - Updating and deleting tasks, contract management, and event handling

## The Checklist

To help you stay on track and ensure a smooth implementation process, we've put together a comprehensive checklist for our To-Do List dApp. Follow along and mark off each task as we progress through the lessons, and by the end, you'll have a fully functional decentralized application up and running!

✅ Setup the Rust project for our To-do dApp

✅ Implement Contract with the logic for Todo-App

✅ Implement Event handling

✅ Handle errors and events in our contract

✅ Deploy our dApp on the Mantra Chain

✅ Test and debug our dApp

## That's a Wrap!

In this lesson, we've introduced our To-Do List dApp and explored its features and functionalities. We've also outlined our course structure and checklist. In the next lesson, we'll dive into the basics of CosmWasm development using Rust. Get ready to code!
