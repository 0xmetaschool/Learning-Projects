# Updating and Deleting To-Do Items

Now that we've got the "add To-do" functionality down, it's time to tackle updating and deleting to-dos for users. Once we've wrapped those up, our Todo-App will be good to go!

## Swap Boilerplate for To-Do Frontend

Let's quickly replace our boilerplate with the corresponding frontend code for adding to-dos. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
git checkout boilerplate04
```

**No need to worry** - this update only touches the frontend components, so all your existing code is safe!

## Updating a Todo

To add functionality for updating a task, we'll create a function `execute_update_entry` that takes in the task's `id`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, and `owner`. This function will return a success response with the updated task’s ID.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here

}
```

Before updating the task, we'll fetch the existing task from storage and check if the owner matches the one trying to update it. If the ownership does not match, return an `Unauthorized` error.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Load the existing task from storage
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;

    // Check if the owner matches the one trying to update
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }
}
```

To update a specific task, we first need to create a new task with the updated fields. Next, we save this updated task to storage. Finally, we return a success response that includes the ID of the updated task.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }

    // Create a new task with the updated fields
    let updated_entry = Entry {
        id,
        description: description.unwrap_or(entry.description),
        status: status.unwrap_or(entry.status),
        priority: priority.unwrap_or(entry.priority),
        owner,
    };

    // Save the updated task to storage
    LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &updated_entry)?;

    // Return a success response with the updated task's ID
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_update_entry")
        .add_attribute("updated_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}

```

The `unwrap_or` method checks if an `Option` contains a value. If it does, it uses that value; if not, it falls back to the provided default, which in this case are existing values from the `entry` struct. And there you go, our `execute_update_entry` function is ready.

## Deleting a To-Do

To implement functionality for deleting a task, we will create a function `execute_delete_entry` that takes in the task's `id` and `owner`. This function will return a success response with the deleted task’s ID. 

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here
    
}
```

Let’s fetch the task from storage using its `id`, and then verify that the `owner` provided matches the owner of the task stored in the database. If the ownership does not match, return an `Unauthorized` error.

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Load the existing task from storage
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;

    // Check if the owner matches the one trying to delete
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }
}
```

If the ownership check passes, remove the task from storage and return a success response with the ID of the deleted task.

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }

    // Remove the task from storage
    LIST.remove(deps.storage, id);

    // Return a success response with the deleted task's ID
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_delete_entry")
        .add_attribute("deleted_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}
```

Our `execute_delete_entry` function is now complete and ready for handling task deletions. Your `contract.rs` should now look like [this](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/building-on-MANTRA-chain/blob/complete-code/contract/src/contract.rs). 

This completes our smart contract for the to-do app. Next, let’s deploy it and test its functionality with our frontend boilerplate.

## Compiling our Smart Contract

Before proceeding, make sure your terminal is open in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/contract` directory. Start by sourcing the `mantrachaind-cli.env` file to the terminal using the following command:

```bash
source mantrachaind-cli.env
```

Next, compile our smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Now before we upload the `cw_to_do_list.wasm` to the Testnet , we will need to optimize it.

## Optimizing our Contract

⚠️ Just make sure you've got Docker up and running on your machine before you get started. Run the following command to optimize our code.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

## Deploying the Contract

Run the following command to upload your wasm binary to the network and store the response in the `RES` variable. This response will contain the unique Code ID of your uploaded binary.

```bash
RES=$(mantrachaind tx wasm store artifacts/cw_to_do_list.wasm --from wallet --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 --chain-id mantra-hongbai-1 --gas-prices 0.0002uom --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2 -y --output json)
echo $RES
```

Next, use the `RES` variable to request the transaction hash, stored as `TX_HASH`. With this hash, you can then fetch the full transaction details, including events, and extract the `CODE_ID` from the response.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(echo $RES | jq -r .txhash)
CODE_ID=$(mantrachaind query tx --type hash $TX_HASH --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 -o json| jq -r '.logs[0].events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

## Instantiating the Contract

To instantiate our smart contract, use the `mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate` command. In addition to the `CODE_ID`, wallet, label, and transaction flag `TXFLAG`, you also need to specify your wallet address as the owner of the contract. Replace the placeholder `wallet_address_here` in the command below with your actual wallet address:

```bash
mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"owner": "wallet_address_here"}' --from wallet --label "cw-to-do-list" --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --gas-prices 0.25uom --gas auto
```

This command initializes the contract with your wallet address as the owner, using the specified code ID and network settings, and automatically calculates the gas limit and adjustment. Once the process completes, We can fetch the contract details using `mantrachaind` and store it inside `CONTRACT` for interaction

```bash
CONTRACT=$(mantrachaind query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')
echo $CONTRACT
```

Copy the smart contract address and paste it into the `.env` file located in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/interface/` directory.

## Interacting with the Frontend

To start our frontend, navigate to the `interface` directory, install all dependencies using `npm install`, and then run the development environment.

![31.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/31.gif)

Once the development server is up and running, you can access your application in your web browser by navigating to the localhost URL.
