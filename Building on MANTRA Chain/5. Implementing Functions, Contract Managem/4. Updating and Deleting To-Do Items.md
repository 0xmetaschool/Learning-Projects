# Updating and Deleting To-Do Items

Now that we've got the "add To-do" functionality down, it's time to tackle updating and deleting to-dos for users. Once we've wrapped those up, our Todo-App will be good to go!

## **Swap Boilerplate for To-Do Frontend**

Let's quickly replace our boilerplate with the corresponding frontend code for adding to-dos. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
git checkout boilerplate04
```

**No need to worry** - this update only touches the frontend components, so all your existing code is safe!

## Updating a Todo

To add functionality for updating a task, we'll create a function `execute_update_entry` that takes in the task's `id`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, and `owner`. This function will return a success response with the updated task‚Äôs ID.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here

}
```

Before updating the task, we'll fetch the existing task from storage and check if the owner matches the one trying to update it. If the ownership does not match, return an `Unauthorized` error.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Load the existing task from storage
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;

    // Check if the owner matches the one trying to update
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }
}
```

To update a specific task, we first need to create a new task with the updated fields. Next, we save this updated task to storage. Finally, we return a success response that includes the ID of the updated task.

```rust
pub fn execute_update_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    description: Option<String>,
    status: Option<Status>,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }

    // Create a new task with the updated fields
    let updated_entry = Entry {
        id,
        description: description.unwrap_or(entry.description),
        status: status.unwrap_or(entry.status),
        priority: priority.unwrap_or(entry.priority),
        owner,
    };

    // Save the updated task to storage
    LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &updated_entry)?;

    // Return a success response with the updated task's ID
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_update_entry")
        .add_attribute("updated_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}

```

The `unwrap_or` method checks if an `Option` contains a value. If it does, it uses that value; if not, it falls back to the provided default, which in this case are existing values from the `entry` struct. And there you go, our `execute_update_entry` function is ready.

## Deleting a To-Do

To implement functionality for deleting a task, we will create a function `execute_delete_entry` that takes in the task's `id` and `owner`. This function will return a success response with the deleted task‚Äôs ID. 

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here
    
}
```

Let‚Äôs fetch the task from storage using its `id`, and then verify that the `owner` provided matches the owner of the task stored in the database. If the ownership does not match, return an `Unauthorized` error.

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Load the existing task from storage
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;

    // Check if the owner matches the one trying to delete
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }
}
```

If the ownership check passes, remove the task from storage and return a success response with the ID of the deleted task.

```rust
pub fn execute_delete_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    id: u64,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let entry = LIST.load(deps.storage, id)?;
    if owner != entry.owner {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
    }

    // Remove the task from storage
    LIST.remove(deps.storage, id);

    // Return a success response with the deleted task's ID
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_delete_entry")
        .add_attribute("deleted_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}
```

Our `execute_delete_entry` function is now complete and ready for handling task deletions. Your `contract.rs` should now look like [this](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/building-on-MANTRA-chain/blob/complete-code/contract/src/contract.rs). 

This completes our smart contract for the to-do app. Next, let‚Äôs deploy it and test its functionality with our frontend boilerplate.

## Compiling our Smart Contract


‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: After switching branches, the `mantrachaind-cli.env` file may have reset to default values. Before proceeding, ensure:

1. Your terminal is in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/contract` directory
2. The contents of `mantrachaind-cli.env` match your OS-specific configuration from Lesson 5
   - For Linux users: Verify Linux-specific settings
   - For MacOS users: Ensure MacOS-specific values are set

Once verified, source the environment file:
```bash
source mantrachaind-cli.env
```

> üí° **Tip**: If the values don't match your OS configuration, copy your working environment variables from Lesson 5 before proceeding.


Next, compile our smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

![22.1.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/4.%20Updating%20and%20Deleting%20To-Do%20Items/22.1.webp?raw=true)

Now before we upload the `to_do_list.wasm` to the Testnet , we will need to optimize it.

## Optimizing our Contract

‚ö†Ô∏è Just make sure you've got Docker up and running on your machine before you get started.

### For Linux, Windows WSL, and Intel-based Mac:

```bash
cargo run-script optimize
```

### For Mac with M1/M2 chip:

```bash
cargo run-script optimize-64
```

These scripts will execute the optimization process using the appropriate Docker image for your system architecture. The optimized `.wasm` file will be generated in the `artifacts` directory.

![22.2.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/4.%20Updating%20and%20Deleting%20To-Do%20Items/22.2.webp?raw=true)

## Deploying the Contract

Run the following command to upload your wasm binary to the network and store the response in the `RES` variable. This response will contain the unique Code ID of your uploaded binary.

Note : If you have funded the wallet named under ‚Äòwallet2‚Äô then do specify ‚Äúwallet2‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwallet‚Äù in the following commands. 

```bash
RES=$(mantrachaind tx wasm store artifacts/to_do_list.wasm --from wallet $TXFLAG -y --output json)
echo "Store response: $RES"
```

Next, use the `RES` variable to request the transaction hash, stored as `TX_HASH`. With this hash, you can then fetch the full transaction details, including events, and extract the `CODE_ID` from the response.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(echo $RES | jq -r .txhash)
CODE_ID=$(mantrachaind query tx $TX_HASH $NODE -o json | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo "Code ID: $CODE_ID"
```

![22.3.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/4.%20Updating%20and%20Deleting%20To-Do%20Items/22.3.webp?raw=true)

# Instantiating the Contract

To instantiate our smart contract, we'll follow these steps to ensure proper setup and verification. Make sure you have the `CODE_ID` from the previous deployment step. Incase you‚Äôve funded wallet2 then do replace `wallet` with `wallet2`  in the following set of commands. 

### 1. Get Wallet Address

First, let's fetch your wallet address:

```bash
WALLET_ADDR=$(mantrachaind keys show wallet2 -a)
echo "Wallet address: $WALLET_ADDR"
```

### 2. Instantiate the Contract

Now we'll instantiate the contract using your wallet address as the owner:

```bash
INIT_TX=$(mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"owner":"'$WALLET_ADDR'"}' \
--from wallet2 \
--label "to-do-list" \
--no-admin \
$TXFLAG \
--output json -y)
echo "Instantiate response: $INIT_TX"
```

### 3. Get Transaction Hash

Fetch the transaction hash for verification:

```bash
INIT_TX_HASH=$(echo $INIT_TX | jq -r .txhash)
echo "Instantiate tx hash: $INIT_TX_HASH"
```

### 4. Get Contract Address

Finally, retrieve and verify the contract address:

```bash
CONTRACT_ADDR=$(mantrachaind query tx $INIT_TX_HASH $NODE --output json | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "instantiate").attributes[] | select(.key == "_contract_address").value')
echo "Contract address: $CONTRACT_ADDR"
```

![22.4.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/4.%20Updating%20and%20Deleting%20To-Do%20Items/22.4.webp?raw=true)

### Important Note

Once you have the contract address, copy it and paste it into the `.env` file located in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/interface/` directory. This address will be needed for future interactions with your smart contract.

## Interacting with the Frontend

To start our frontend, navigate to the `interface` directory, install all dependencies using `npm install ‚Äî-legacy-peer-deps`, and then run the development environment using `npm run dev`.

```jsx
cd interface
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
