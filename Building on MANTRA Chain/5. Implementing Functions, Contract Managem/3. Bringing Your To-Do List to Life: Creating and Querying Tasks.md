# Bringing Your To-Do List to Life: Creating and Querying Tasks

Welcome back! today, we'll focus on implementing the core functionality of our dApp: adding to-dos of varying priorities and displaying them for the user. With the basic structure of our contract already in place, we'll now create specific functions to handle these features.

## Swap Boilerplate for To-Do Frontend

Let's quickly replace our boilerplate with the corresponding frontend code for adding to-dos. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
git checkout boilerplate03
```

**No need to worry** - this update only touches the frontend components, so all your existing code is safe!

## Adding the core functionalities

We’ve already set up the instantiation entry point. Now, to add and display to-dos, we'll implement our `execute` and `query` routes. 

### The Execute Route

The `execute` function is the primary entry point for handling various actions (or messages) in your smart contract. It processes different `ExecuteMsg` variants and routes them to their respective handler functions, such as adding, updating, or deleting to-dos.

To handle different types of messages, we'll create an `execute` function that matches the message variant and calls the corresponding handler function.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::NewEntry {
            description,
            priority,
            owner,
        } => execute_create_new_entry(deps, info, description, priority, owner),
        ExecuteMsg::UpdateEntry {
            id,
            description,
            status,
            priority,
            owner
        } => execute_update_entry(deps, info, id, description, status, priority, owner),
        ExecuteMsg::DeleteEntry { id, owner } => execute_delete_entry(deps, info, id, owner),
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The `execute` function takes in `deps`, `_env`, `info`, and `msg` as inputs. `deps` is the mutable dependency, `_env` provides the environment information, `info` contains message sender details, and `msg` is the action message.
2. **Match Statement:** The function uses a match statement to handle different `ExecuteMsg` variants:
    - `ExecuteMsg::NewEntry { description, priority, owner }`: This calls the `execute_create_new_entry` function to add a new task with the provided description, priority, and owner.
    - `ExecuteMsg::UpdateEntry { id, description, status, priority, owner }`: This calls the `execute_update_entry` function to update an existing task with the specified id, description, status, priority, and owner.
    - `ExecuteMsg::DeleteEntry { id, owner }`: This calls the `execute_delete_entry` function to delete a task with the given id and owner.

Each handler function performs the specific operations needed for the action and returns a response. We will be using the `UpdateEntry` and `DeleteEntry` in the next lesson.

### The Query Route

The `query` function is the main entry point for retrieving data from your smart contract. It processes different `QueryMsg` variants and routes them to their respective handler functions, such as querying user-specific to-do lists.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::QueryUserList { user, start_after, limit } => {
            to_binary(&query_user_list(deps, user, start_after, limit)?)
        }
    }
}

```

Let's break down the `query` function. It starts by receiving a query message specifying the data requested. The function uses a match statement to identify the query type and routes it to the appropriate handler function, like `query_user_list` for a user's to-do list. The handler fetches the data from storage and the function returns this data in binary format, ready for the client to use.

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The `query` function takes in `deps`, `_env`, and `msg` as inputs. `deps` provides access to the contract's dependencies, `_env` gives environment information, and `msg` is the query message.
2. **Match Statement:** The function uses a match statement to handle different `QueryMsg` variants:
    - `QueryMsg::QueryUserList { user, start_after, limit }`: This calls the `query_user_list` function to fetch the to-do list for a specific user, with optional pagination parameters (`start_after` and `limit`).
3. **Binary Conversion:** `to_binary(&query_user_list(deps, user, start_after, limit)?)`: After fetching the data, the function converts it to a binary format using `to_binary`, making it suitable for returning to the client.

We will be implementing the `query_user_list` function to perform the actual data retrieval based on the provided parameters and returns the result.

## Adding Tasks to Your To-Do List: The `execute_create_new_entry` Function

The `execute` function is the main entry point for executing different types of messages (or actions) on the contract. It mainly handles the dispatch of `ExecuteMsg` variants to their respective handler functions, which in our case will be the functions for adding and updating to-dos. 

Think of the `execute_create_new_entry` function as your personal assistant. Whenever you want to add a new task to your to-do list, this function is the one that takes your request and makes it happen on the blockchain. It's like having a super-efficient secretary who meticulously organizes your tasks and ensures they're safely stored for later.

**What Happens When You Add a Task?**

Let's break down the process of adding a task to your to-do list on the blockchain:

1. **The Request:** You send a message to the smart contract, specifying the details of your new task (description and optional priority).
2. **Assigning a Unique ID:** The contract generates a unique ID for your task, so it can be easily distinguished from other tasks. Think of it like a serial number for each item on your list.
3. **Creating a Task Record:** The contract creates a record of your task, storing the description, priority, and other relevant details (like the current status, which is always "To Do" for a new task).
4. **Saving to the Blockchain:** The task record is then securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring it's tamper-proof and can't be accidentally lost or deleted.
5. **Confirmation:** The contract sends you a confirmation message, letting you know that your task has been successfully added and providing you with its unique ID.

**The Code:**

To add functionality for creating a new task, we'll create a function `execute_create_new_entry` that takes in the task's description, priority, and owner. This function will return a success response with the new task's ID.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here

}
```

Before creating the new task, we'll generate a unique ID for the task by updating the entry sequence.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Generate a unique ID for the new task
    let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update::<_, cosmwasm_std::StdError>(deps.storage, |id| Ok(id.add(1)))?;
}
```

To create a new task, we need to construct a new Entry struct with the provided details and default values for status and priority. Next, we save this new entry to storage. Finally, we return a success response that includes the ID of the new task.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update(deps.storage, |id| -> StdResult<_> {Ok(id.add(1))})?;
    let new_entry = Entry {
        id,
        description,
        status: Status::ToDo,
        priority: priority.unwrap_or(Priority::None),
        owner,
    };
    LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &new_entry)?;
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_create_new_entry")
        .add_attribute("new_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The function takes the necessary inputs (task description, priority, and owner) and returns a `Result`, which will either be `Ok` if the task was successfully added or `Err` if there was a problem.
2. **Unique ID Generation:** `let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update(deps.storage, |id| -> StdResult<_> {Ok(id.add(1))})?;`:
    - This line is where the magic of creating a unique ID happens. It uses the `ENTRY_SEQ` item from storage (which starts at 0) and increments it by 1.
    - `Ok(id.add(1))`: This returns the new id after adding 1.
    - `|id|` is a closure that takes the current value of `id` and returns a new value by adding 1 to it.
3. **Task Creation:** `let new_entry = Entry { ... };`:
    - This creates a new struct called `Entry` which stores data about each task.
    - The fields are filled with the values from the message (`description`, `owner`) and the generated `id`.
    - The status is automatically set to `ToDo`, and the priority is either the value from the message or the default `None`.
4. **Save to Storage:**`LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &new_entry)?;`:
    - This line stores the new `Entry` object in the contract's storage under the `id` we just created.
5. **Success Response:** If everything goes smoothly, the function returns an `Ok` result with a `Response` object containing information about the successful task creation.

And there you have it! The `execute_create_new_entry` function is the powerhouse behind adding new tasks to your to-do list dApp.

## Fetching tasks in your To-Do List: The `query_user_list` Function

Alright! Now that we've successfully added new tasks to our to-do list on the blockchain, let's explore how we can retrieve and view those tasks using the `query_user_list` function. This function allows us to fetch a list of tasks from the contract's storage, optionally filtering by the owner of the tasks and applying pagination to retrieve the list in smaller, more manageable chunks.

**Here's what the code does:**

1. **Sets Limits:** It first figures out how many tasks to show you at most. You can specify this number, or it will use a default limit.
2. **Starting Point and Filtering:** It then checks if you want to start the list from a specific task. If so, it will only look at tasks after that point. You can also choose to only see tasks that belong to a particular user.
3. **Retrieving Tasks:** It then goes through your to-do list stored on the blockchain and gathers the tasks that match your request (based on the starting point and filter).
4. **Organizing and Returning:** Finally, it arranges the tasks neatly into a list and sends that list back to you as a response.

**Let's take a look at the `query_user_list` function code:**

```rust
// Limits for pagination
const MAX_LIMIT: u32 = 30;
const DEFAULT_LIMIT: u32 = 10;

pub fn query_user_list(
    deps: Deps, 
    user: String, 
    start_after: Option<u64>, 
    limit: Option<u32>
) -> StdResult<ListResponse> {
    let limit = limit.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_LIMIT).min(MAX_LIMIT) as usize;
    let start = start_after.map(Bound::exclusive);

    let entries: StdResult<Vec<_>> = LIST
        .range(deps.storage, start, None, Order::Ascending)
        .filter(|item| {
            if let Ok((_, entry)) = item {
                entry.owner == user
            } else {
                false
            }
        })
        .take(limit)
        .collect();

    let result = ListResponse {
        entries: entries?.into_iter().map(|(_, entry)| entry).collect(),
    };
    Ok(result)
}

```

**Explanation:**

- **Constants:** Sets the maximum (`MAX_LIMIT`) and default (`DEFAULT_LIMIT`) number of tasks to return per query.
- **Input Handling:** Takes the input `user` (address), `start_after` (optional task ID to start from), and `limit` (optional number of tasks to return).
- **Querying the Storage:**
    - `LIST.range(deps.storage, start, None, Order::Ascending)`:
        - This line fetches tasks from the `LIST` storage map. The `range` method allows us to specify a starting point (`start`) and an optional ending point (`None` in this case, meaning we fetch until the end of the list). We also specify `Order::Ascending` to get the tasks in ascending order of their IDs.
- **Filtering by User (Optional):**
    - `.filter(|item| { ... })`:
        - This part applies a filter to the retrieved tasks.
        - It checks if the `owner` field of each `entry` matches the `user` input provided in the query.
        - If the `user` input is empty or not provided, the filter won't be applied, and all tasks will be returned.
- **Limiting Results:**
    - `.take(limit)`: This line limits the number of tasks returned to the specified `limit`. If `limit` is set to 10, only the first 10 tasks that match the filter (if any) will be returned.
- **Collecting Results:**
    - `.collect()`: This line collects the filtered and limited tasks into a vector (`Vec<Entry>`), which can be easily processed further.
- **Returning the Result:**
    - Constructs a `ListResponse` containing the filtered and limited entries.
    - Returns this response as a serialized binary using `to_binary`.

With these final steps, the `query_user_list` function neatly packages the retrieved tasks into a `ListResponse` and sends it back to the requester, providing a clear and concise snapshot of the to-do list based on the specified criteria. Finally we can move on to compiling, deploy and interacting with the contract.

You can find the complete contents of `contract.rs` [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/building-on-MANTRA-chain/blob/boilerplate04/contract/src/contract.rs).

## Compiling our Smart Contract

Before proceeding, make sure your terminal is open in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/contract` directory. Start by sourcing the `mantrachaind-cli.env` file to the terminal using the following command:

```bash
source mantrachaind-cli.env
```

Next, compile our smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

![26.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/26.gif)

Now before we upload the `cw_to_do_list.wasm` to the Testnet , we will need to optimize it.

## Optimizing our Contract

⚠️ Just make sure you've got Docker up and running on your machine before you get started. Run the following command to optimize our code.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
```

![27.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/27.gif)

## Deploying the Contract

Run the following command to upload your wasm binary to the network and store the response in the `RES` variable. This response will contain the unique Code ID of your uploaded binary.

```bash
RES=$(mantrachaind tx wasm store artifacts/cw_to_do_list.wasm --from wallet --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 --chain-id mantra-hongbai-1 --gas-prices 0.0002uom --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2 -y --output json)
echo $RES
```

Next, use the `RES` variable to request the transaction hash, stored as `TX_HASH`. With this hash, you can then fetch the full transaction details, including events, and extract the `CODE_ID` from the response.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(echo $RES | jq -r .txhash)
CODE_ID=$(mantrachaind query tx $TX_HASH --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 -o json| jq -r '.logs[0].events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo $CODE_ID
```

## Instantiating the Contract

To instantiate our smart contract, use the `mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate` command. In addition to the `CODE_ID`, wallet, label, and transaction flag `TXFLAG`, you also need to specify your wallet address as the owner of the contract. Replace the placeholder `wallet_address_here` in the command below with your actual wallet address:

```bash
mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"owner": "wallet_address_here"}' --from wallet --label "cw-to-do-list" --no-admin --node https://rpc.hongbai.mantrachain.io:443 --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --gas-prices 0.35uom --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.4
```

![29.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/29.gif)

This command initializes the contract with your wallet address as the owner, using the specified code ID and network settings, and automatically calculates the gas limit and adjustment. Once the process completes, We can fetch the contract details using `mantrachaind` and store it inside `CONTRACT` for interaction

```bash
CONTRACT=$(mantrachaind query wasm list-contract-by-code $CODE_ID $NODE --output json | jq -r '.contracts[-1]')
echo $CONTRACT
```

![30.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/30.gif)

Finally, Copy the smart contract address and paste it into the `.env` file located in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/interface/` directory.

## Interacting with the Frontend

To start our frontend, navigate to the `interface` directory, install all dependencies using `npm install`, and then run the development environment.

![31.gif](Lesson%2021%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin%20a1233499e256424f84d84c0406305ebb/31.gif)

Once the development server is up and running, you can access your application in your web browser by navigating to the localhost URL. 

### Testing the Todo App

## That’s a Wrap

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented the core functionalities of your To-Do List dApp by adding tasks with `execute_create_new_entry` and retrieving them with `query_user_list`. While you can now add and view to-dos, our dApp still needs the functionality for updating and deleting tasks. Join us in the next lesson, where we'll bring full functionality to our To-Do List App. See you there!
