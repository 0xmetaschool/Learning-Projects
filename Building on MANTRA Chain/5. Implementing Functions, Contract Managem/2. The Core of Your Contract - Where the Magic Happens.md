# The Core of Your Contract: -  Where the Magic Happens

Welcome back, devs!  We've laid the groundwork by defining our messages in `msg.rs`, setting up storage in `state.rs`, and establishing error handling in `error.rs`. Now, it's time to dive into the heart of our to-do list dApp: the `contract.rs` file.

This file is where all the action takes place. It's the brain of our smart contract, containing the logic that defines how our dApp will behave on the MANTRA Chain. 

## Thinking Process: Designing the Contract's Logic

Before we start coding, let's take a moment to brainstorm the core functionality our to-do list contract needs to provide:

1. **Initialization:** When the contract is first deployed, we need to set up some initial state, like keeping track of the next available task ID.
2. **Creating Tasks:** Users should be able to add new tasks to their list.
3. **Updating Tasks:** They should be able to modify existing tasks (e.g., change the description, mark as complete).
4. **Deleting Tasks:** They should be able to remove tasks they no longer need.
5. **Querying Tasks:** Users should be able to view their list of tasks or get details about a specific task.

To achieve this functionality, we'll need to define three special functions called *entry points*: `instantiate`, `execute`, and `query`.

## Entry Points: The Gates to Your Contract

Think of entry points as the gateways through which external entities (users or other contracts) can interact with your smart contract. Each entry point serves a distinct purpose:

- **`instantiate`:** This function is called when the contract is first created (deployed) on the blockchain. It's responsible for setting up the initial state of the contract.
- **`execute`:** This function is called whenever someone wants to make a change to the contract's state. It handles messages that trigger actions like adding, updating, or deleting tasks.
- **`query`:** This function is called when someone wants to read information from the contract without making any changes. It handles queries that retrieve data, such as getting the list of tasks.

## Understanding Imports: Gathering Your Tools

Think of the top of your `contract.rs` file as your toolbox, where you gather all the necessary tools and materials before starting your project. In Rust, these tools come in the form of external modules and crates (libraries) that provide pre-built functionality.

**What You'll Need to Import:**

In order to build our to-do list contract, we'll need to import the following items:

- **Core CosmWasm Functionality:**
    - `cosmwasm_std`: This crate provides the essential building blocks for CosmWasm smart contracts, including types for interacting with the blockchain, managing storage, and handling messages and queries.
    - `cw2`: This crate offers additional utilities and conventions for CosmWasm development, such as the `set_contract_version` function.
    - `cw_storage_plus`: This crate enhances the storage capabilities of CosmWasm, providing convenient ways to store and retrieve data.
- **Custom Modules:**
    - `crate::error::ContractError`: This imports the custom error types you defined in `error.rs` to handle specific errors that might arise in your contract's logic.
    - `crate::msg::{...}`: This imports the message and query types you defined in `msg.rs`, establishing the communication interface for your contract.
    - `crate::state::{...}`: This imports the state variables and data structures you defined in `state.rs`, which will hold the information about your to-do items.

Add the following lines in the [`contract.rs`](http://contract.rs) file:

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;
use cosmwasm_std::{
    to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Order, Response, StdResult,
};
use cw2::set_contract_version;
use cw_storage_plus::Bound;
use std::ops::Add;

use crate::error::ContractError;
use crate::msg::{ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, ListResponse, QueryMsg};
use crate::state::{Entry, Priority, Status, ENTRY_SEQ, LIST};
```

Let's break down this code snippet line by line to unravel its meaning and purpose in the CosmWasm to-do list contract:

1. `#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]`:
    - This is a conditional compilation attribute. It tells the Rust compiler to include the following item (in this case, the `use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;` statement) only when the code is not being built as a library.
    - When building a smart contract, you typically don't want to include the `entry_point` macro if you're just compiling the contract as a library for testing or development purposes. This attribute helps streamline the compilation process and avoid unnecessary errors.
2. `use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;`:
    - This line imports the `entry_point` macro from the `cosmwasm_std` crate (library).
    - The `entry_point` macro is used to mark specific functions in your contract as entry points. These entry points are the functions that will be called by the CosmWasm runtime when interacting with your contract (e.g., instantiating, executing, or querying).
3. `use cosmwasm_std::{to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Order, Response, StdResult};`:
    - This line imports several essential types and functions from the `cosmwasm_std` crate:
        - `to_binary`: Used to convert a Rust value into a binary format suitable for storage or transmission on the blockchain.
        - `Binary`: Represents a binary blob of data (array of bytes) that can be used to store or transmit information on the blockchain.
        - `Deps`: Provides read-only access to the contract's dependencies (storage, API, querier).
        - `DepsMut`: Provides mutable access to the contract's dependencies, allowing you to modify the storage.
        - `Env`: Provides information about the environment in which the contract is executing, such as block height and time.
        - `MessageInfo`: Contains information about the sender of a message and the funds they sent with it.
        - `Order`: An enum used for specifying the order in which to iterate over items in storage.
        - `Response`: Represents the response that the contract sends back after executing a message or query.
        - `StdResult`: A type used for representing the result of an operation that can either succeed (returning an `Ok` value) or fail (returning an `Err` with an error).
4. `use cw2::set_contract_version;`:
    - Imports the `set_contract_version` function from the `cw2` crate. This function is used to store the contract's version in storage for future reference, which is helpful for upgrades.
5. `use cw_storage_plus::Bound;`:
    - Imports the `Bound` type from the `cw_storage_plus` crate. It's used for specifying a range of keys when querying data from the contract's storage.
6. `use std::ops::Add;`:
    - Imports the `Add` trait from the Rust standard library. This trait defines the behavior for the `+` (addition) operator. It's used in the contract to increment the task ID counter.
7. `use crate::error::ContractError;`:
    - Imports the `ContractError` enum defined in your `error.rs` file. This enum is used for representing the different errors that your contract can encounter.
8. `use crate::msg::{EntryResponse, ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, ListResponse, QueryMsg};`:
    - Imports the message and query types (`ExecuteMsg`, `InstantiateMsg`, `QueryMsg`) and response types (`EntryResponse`, `ListResponse`) from your `msg.rs` file.
9. `use crate::state::{Entry, Priority, Status, ENTRY_SEQ, LIST};`:
    - Imports the data structures (`Entry`, `Status`, `Priority`) and storage items (`ENTRY_SEQ`, `LIST`) from your `state.rs` file.

By understanding these imports, you now have a clearer picture of the tools and components available for building your to-do list contract.

## The `instantiate` Function: Preparing Your dApp for Launch

The `instantiate` function is the first thing that gets called when your smart contract is deployed to the MANTRA Chain. It's like setting up a new house – you need to furnish it, stock the fridge, and make it ready for guests to arrive. Similarly, the `instantiate` function prepares your contract to start interacting with the world by:

- **Version Control:** It stores the name and version of your contract in the blockchain's storage, ensuring a smooth upgrade path in the future.
- **Data Initialization:** It sets up any necessary data structures in the contract's storage. In our to-do list, this involves initializing a counter to track the unique IDs assigned to each task.
- **Confirmation:** It returns a message to the user (or another contract) confirming that the instantiation was successful.

**Let’s see what we will write in the code:**

1. **Define the function:** Create a function named `instantiate`.
    - It will need to be public (`pub`) so it can be called from outside.
    - Mark it with the `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]` attribute to tell CosmWasm this is a special function.
    - The function should accept four parameters (`deps`, `_env`, `_info`, `_msg`), which provide information about the environment and the message that triggered the function. We'll discuss these in more detail later.
    - It should return a `Result<Response, ContractError>`, meaning it will either return a successful response or an error.
2. **Set the contract version:** Use the `set_contract_version` function to record the contract's name and version in the blockchain's storage.
3. **Initialize the ID counter:** Start a counter at 0 to keep track of the IDs we'll assign to tasks.
4. **Return a response:** Indicate that the contract was successfully instantiated.

Now, let's see the code for the `instantiate` function:

```rust
// version info for migration
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = "crates.io:cw-to-do-list";
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION");

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;

    ENTRY_SEQ.save(deps.storage, &0u64)?;

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "instantiate"))
}

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`CONTRACT_NAME`, `CONTRACT_VERSION`**: These store details about the contract which are used while upgrading the contract in the future.
2. **`#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]`:** This attribute specifies that the following function is an entry point for the contract. In simple terms, it tells the CosmWasm runtime that this function should be called when the contract is instantiated.
3. **`instantiate` Function Parameters:**
    - **`deps`:** Short for "dependencies," this gives you access to various tools and information about the blockchain environment, including the ability to read and write data to the contract's storage.
    - **`_env`:** Provides information about the environment in which the contract is being executed, such as the block height and timestamp. In this case, we are not using it, so we will just leave it here.
    - **`_info`:** Contains information about the sender of the message that triggered the contract execution. In this case, we are not using it, so we will just leave it here.
    - **`_msg`:** Contains the message sent by the user or another contract when instantiating the contract (as defined in `InstantiateMsg`). We are not using it now, so we will just leave it here.
4. **Return Type:** The function returns a `Result<Response, ContractError>`, indicating that it can either succeed (returning a `Response`) or fail (returning a `ContractError`).
5. **Function Body:**
    - `set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;`: This line uses the `set_contract_version` function (imported from the `cw2` library) to store the contract's name and version in the blockchain's storage.
    - `ENTRY_SEQ.save(deps.storage, &0u64)?;`: This line initializes the `ENTRY_SEQ` variable (from `state.rs`) to zero in the contract's storage. This variable will keep track of the next available ID for a new task.
    - `Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("method", "instantiate"))`: This line creates a `Response` object indicating successful instantiation and adds an attribute "method" with the value "instantiate" for informational purposes.

With the `instantiate` function in place, our contract is now ready to handle actions and queries, which we'll explore in the next lessons.

## Wrap Up
