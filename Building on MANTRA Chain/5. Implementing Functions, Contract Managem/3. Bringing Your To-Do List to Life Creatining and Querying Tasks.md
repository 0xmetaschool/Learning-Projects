# Bringing Your To-Do List to Life: Creating and Querying Tasks
Welcome back! today, we'll focus on implementing the core functionality of our dApp: adding to-dos of varying priorities and displaying them for the user. With the basic structure of our contract already in place, we'll now create specific functions to handle these features.

## **Swap Boilerplate for To-Do Frontend**

Let's quickly replace our boilerplate with the corresponding frontend code for adding to-dos. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
git checkout boilerplate03
```

**No need to worry** - this update only touches the frontend components, so all your existing code is safe!

## Adding the core functionalities

We’ve already set up the instantiation entry point. Now, to add and display to-dos, we'll implement our `execute` and `query` routes. 

### The Execute Route

The `execute` function is the primary entry point for handling various actions (or messages) in your smart contract. It processes different `ExecuteMsg` variants and routes them to their respective handler functions, such as adding, updating, or deleting to-dos.

To handle different types of messages, we'll create an `execute` function that matches the message variant and calls the corresponding handler function.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::NewEntry {
            description,
            priority,
            owner,
        } => execute_create_new_entry(deps, info, description, priority, owner),
        ExecuteMsg::UpdateEntry {
            id,
            description,
            status,
            priority,
            owner
        } => execute_update_entry(deps, info, id, description, status, priority, owner),
        ExecuteMsg::DeleteEntry { id, owner } => execute_delete_entry(deps, info, id, owner),
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The `execute` function takes in `deps`, `_env`, `info`, and `msg` as inputs. `deps` is the mutable dependency, `_env` provides the environment information, `info` contains message sender details, and `msg` is the action message.
2. **Match Statement:** The function uses a match statement to handle different `ExecuteMsg` variants:
    - `ExecuteMsg::NewEntry { description, priority, owner }`: This calls the `execute_create_new_entry` function to add a new task with the provided description, priority, and owner.
    - `ExecuteMsg::UpdateEntry { id, description, status, priority, owner }`: This calls the `execute_update_entry` function to update an existing task with the specified id, description, status, priority, and owner.
    - `ExecuteMsg::DeleteEntry { id, owner }`: This calls the `execute_delete_entry` function to delete a task with the given id and owner.

Each handler function performs the specific operations needed for the action and returns a response. We will be using the `UpdateEntry` and `DeleteEntry` in the next lesson.

### The Query Route

The `query` function is the main entry point for retrieving data from your smart contract. It processes different `QueryMsg` variants and routes them to their respective handler functions, such as querying user-specific to-do lists.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::QueryUserList { user, start_after, limit } => {
            to_binary(&query_user_list(deps, user, start_after, limit)?)
        }
    }
}

```

Let's break down the `query` function. It starts by receiving a query message specifying the data requested. The function uses a match statement to identify the query type and routes it to the appropriate handler function, like `query_user_list` for a user's to-do list. The handler fetches the data from storage and the function returns this data in binary format, ready for the client to use.

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The `query` function takes in `deps`, `_env`, and `msg` as inputs. `deps` provides access to the contract's dependencies, `_env` gives environment information, and `msg` is the query message.
2. **Match Statement:** The function uses a match statement to handle different `QueryMsg` variants:
    - `QueryMsg::QueryUserList { user, start_after, limit }`: This calls the `query_user_list` function to fetch the to-do list for a specific user, with optional pagination parameters (`start_after` and `limit`).
3. **Binary Conversion:** `to_binary(&query_user_list(deps, user, start_after, limit)?)`: After fetching the data, the function converts it to a binary format using `to_binary`, making it suitable for returning to the client.

We will be implementing the `query_user_list` function to perform the actual data retrieval based on the provided parameters and returns the result.

## Adding Tasks to Your To-Do List: The `execute_create_new_entry` Function

The `execute` function is the main entry point for executing different types of messages (or actions) on the contract. It mainly handles the dispatch of `ExecuteMsg` variants to their respective handler functions, which in our case will be the functions for adding and updating to-dos. 

Think of the `execute_create_new_entry` function as your personal assistant. Whenever you want to add a new task to your to-do list, this function is the one that takes your request and makes it happen on the blockchain. It's like having a super-efficient secretary who meticulously organizes your tasks and ensures they're safely stored for later.

**What Happens When You Add a Task?**

Let's break down the process of adding a task to your to-do list on the blockchain:

1. **The Request:** You send a message to the smart contract, specifying the details of your new task (description and optional priority).
2. **Assigning a Unique ID:** The contract generates a unique ID for your task, so it can be easily distinguished from other tasks. Think of it like a serial number for each item on your list.
3. **Creating a Task Record:** The contract creates a record of your task, storing the description, priority, and other relevant details (like the current status, which is always "To Do" for a new task).
4. **Saving to the Blockchain:** The task record is then securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring it's tamper-proof and can't be accidentally lost or deleted.
5. **Confirmation:** The contract sends you a confirmation message, letting you know that your task has been successfully added and providing you with its unique ID.

**The Code:**

To add functionality for creating a new task, we'll create a function `execute_create_new_entry` that takes in the task's description, priority, and owner. This function will return a success response with the new task's ID.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {

    // Code goes here

}
```

Before creating the new task, we'll generate a unique ID for the task by updating the entry sequence.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Generate a unique ID for the new task
    let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update::<_, cosmwasm_std::StdError>(deps.storage, |id| Ok(id.add(1)))?;
}
```

To create a new task, we need to construct a new Entry struct with the provided details and default values for status and priority. Next, we save this new entry to storage. Finally, we return a success response that includes the ID of the new task.

```rust
pub fn execute_create_new_entry(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    description: String,
    priority: Option<Priority>,
    owner: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update(deps.storage, |id| -> StdResult<_> {Ok(id.add(1))})?;
    let new_entry = Entry {
        id,
        description,
        status: Status::ToDo,
        priority: priority.unwrap_or(Priority::None),
        owner,
    };
    LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &new_entry)?;
    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("method", "execute_create_new_entry")
        .add_attribute("new_entry_id", id.to_string()))
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The function takes the necessary inputs (task description, priority, and owner) and returns a `Result`, which will either be `Ok` if the task was successfully added or `Err` if there was a problem.
2. **Unique ID Generation:** `let id = ENTRY_SEQ.update(deps.storage, |id| -> StdResult<_> {Ok(id.add(1))})?;`:
    - This line is where the magic of creating a unique ID happens. It uses the `ENTRY_SEQ` item from storage (which starts at 0) and increments it by 1.
    - `Ok(id.add(1))`: This returns the new id after adding 1.
    - `|id|` is a closure that takes the current value of `id` and returns a new value by adding 1 to it.
3. **Task Creation:** `let new_entry = Entry { ... };`:
    - This creates a new struct called `Entry` which stores data about each task.
    - The fields are filled with the values from the message (`description`, `owner`) and the generated `id`.
    - The status is automatically set to `ToDo`, and the priority is either the value from the message or the default `None`.
4. **Save to Storage:**`LIST.save(deps.storage, id, &new_entry)?;`:
    - This line stores the new `Entry` object in the contract's storage under the `id` we just created.
5. **Success Response:** If everything goes smoothly, the function returns an `Ok` result with a `Response` object containing information about the successful task creation.

And there you have it! The `execute_create_new_entry` function is the powerhouse behind adding new tasks to your to-do list dApp.

## Fetching tasks in your To-Do List: The `query_user_list` Function

Alright! Now that we've successfully added new tasks to our to-do list on the blockchain, let's explore how we can retrieve and view those tasks using the `query_user_list` function. This function allows us to fetch a list of tasks from the contract's storage, optionally filtering by the owner of the tasks and applying pagination to retrieve the list in smaller, more manageable chunks.

**Here's what the code does:**

1. **Sets Limits:** It first figures out how many tasks to show you at most. You can specify this number, or it will use a default limit.
2. **Starting Point and Filtering:** It then checks if you want to start the list from a specific task. If so, it will only look at tasks after that point. You can also choose to only see tasks that belong to a particular user.
3. **Retrieving Tasks:** It then goes through your to-do list stored on the blockchain and gathers the tasks that match your request (based on the starting point and filter).
4. **Organizing and Returning:** Finally, it arranges the tasks neatly into a list and sends that list back to you as a response.

**Let's take a look at the `query_user_list` function code:**

```rust
// Limits for pagination
const MAX_LIMIT: u32 = 30;
const DEFAULT_LIMIT: u32 = 10;

pub fn query_user_list(
    deps: Deps, 
    user: String, 
    start_after: Option<u64>, 
    limit: Option<u32>
) -> StdResult<ListResponse> {
    let limit = limit.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_LIMIT).min(MAX_LIMIT) as usize;
    let start = start_after.map(Bound::exclusive);

    let entries: StdResult<Vec<_>> = LIST
        .range(deps.storage, start, None, Order::Ascending)
        .filter(|item| {
            if let Ok((_, entry)) = item {
                entry.owner == user
            } else {
                false
            }
        })
        .take(limit)
        .collect();

    let result = ListResponse {
        entries: entries?.into_iter().map(|(_, entry)| entry).collect(),
    };
    Ok(result)
}

```

**Explanation:**

- **Constants:** Sets the maximum (`MAX_LIMIT`) and default (`DEFAULT_LIMIT`) number of tasks to return per query.
- **Input Handling:** Takes the input `user` (address), `start_after` (optional task ID to start from), and `limit` (optional number of tasks to return).
- **Querying the Storage:**
    - `LIST.range(deps.storage, start, None, Order::Ascending)`:
        - This line fetches tasks from the `LIST` storage map. The `range` method allows us to specify a starting point (`start`) and an optional ending point (`None` in this case, meaning we fetch until the end of the list). We also specify `Order::Ascending` to get the tasks in ascending order of their IDs.
- **Filtering by User (Optional):**
    - `.filter(|item| { ... })`:
        - This part applies a filter to the retrieved tasks.
        - It checks if the `owner` field of each `entry` matches the `user` input provided in the query.
        - If the `user` input is empty or not provided, the filter won't be applied, and all tasks will be returned.
- **Limiting Results:**
    - `.take(limit)`: This line limits the number of tasks returned to the specified `limit`. If `limit` is set to 10, only the first 10 tasks that match the filter (if any) will be returned.
- **Collecting Results:**
    - `.collect()`: This line collects the filtered and limited tasks into a vector (`Vec<Entry>`), which can be easily processed further.
- **Returning the Result:**
    - Constructs a `ListResponse` containing the filtered and limited entries.
    - Returns this response as a serialized binary using `to_binary`.

With these final steps, the `query_user_list` function neatly packages the retrieved tasks into a `ListResponse` and sends it back to the requester, providing a clear and concise snapshot of the to-do list based on the specified criteria. Finally we can move on to compiling, deploy and interacting with the contract.

You can find the complete contents of `contract.rs` [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/building-on-MANTRA-chain/blob/boilerplate04/contract/src/contract.rs).

## Compiling our Smart Contract

⚠️ **Important**: After switching branches, the `mantrachaind-cli.env` file may have reset to default values. Before proceeding, ensure:

1. Your terminal is in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/contract` directory
2. The contents of `mantrachaind-cli.env` match your OS-specific configuration from Lesson 5
   - For Linux users: Verify Linux-specific settings
   - For MacOS users: Ensure MacOS-specific values are set

Once verified, source the environment file:
```bash
source mantrachaind-cli.env
```

> 💡 **Tip**: If the values don't match your OS configuration, copy your working environment variables from Lesson 5 before proceeding.

Next, compile our smart contract by running the following command:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

![21.1.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/3.%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin/21.1.webp?raw=true)

Now before we upload the `to_do_list.wasm` to the Testnet , we will need to optimize it.

## Optimizing our Contract

⚠️ Just make sure you've got Docker up and running on your machine before you get started.

Instead of running the Docker command directly, we've added convenient scripts in our `Cargo.toml` file under the `[package.metadata.scripts]` section. You can run the appropriate command based on your system:

### For Linux, Windows WSL, and Intel-based Mac:

```bash
cargo run-script optimize
```

### For Mac with M1/M2 chip:

```bash
cargo run-script optimize-64
```

These scripts will execute the optimization process using the appropriate Docker image for your system architecture. The optimized `.wasm` file will be generated in the `artifacts` directory.

![21.2.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/3.%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin/21.2.webp?raw=true)

## Deploying the Contract

Run the following command to upload your wasm binary to the network and store the response in the `RES` variable. This response will contain the unique Code ID of your uploaded binary.

Note : If you have funded the wallet named under ‘wallet2’ then do specify “wallet2” instead of “wallet” in the following commands. 

```bash
RES=$(mantrachaind tx wasm store artifacts/to_do_list.wasm --from wallet $TXFLAG -y --output json)
echo "Store response: $RES"
```

Next, use the `RES` variable to request the transaction hash, stored as `TX_HASH`. With this hash, you can then fetch the full transaction details, including events, and extract the `CODE_ID` from the response.

```bash
TX_HASH=$(echo $RES | jq -r .txhash)
CODE_ID=$(mantrachaind query tx $TX_HASH $NODE -o json | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "store_code") | .attributes[] | select(.key == "code_id") | .value')
echo "Code ID: $CODE_ID"
```

![21.3.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/3.%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin/21.3.webp?raw=true)

# Instantiating the Contract

To instantiate our smart contract, we'll follow these steps to ensure proper setup and verification. Make sure you have the `CODE_ID` from the previous deployment step. Incase you’ve funded wallet2 then do replace `wallet` with `wallet2`  in the following set of commands. 

### 1. Get Wallet Address

First, let's fetch your wallet address:

```bash
WALLET_ADDR=$(mantrachaind keys show wallet2 -a)
echo "Wallet address: $WALLET_ADDR"
```

### 2. Instantiate the Contract

Now we'll instantiate the contract using your wallet address as the owner:

```bash
INIT_TX=$(mantrachaind tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID '{"owner":"'$WALLET_ADDR'"}' \
--from wallet2 \
--label "to-do-list" \
--no-admin \
$TXFLAG \
--output json -y)
echo "Instantiate response: $INIT_TX"
```

### 3. Get Transaction Hash

Fetch the transaction hash for verification:

```bash
INIT_TX_HASH=$(echo $INIT_TX | jq -r .txhash)
echo "Instantiate tx hash: $INIT_TX_HASH"
```

### 4. Get Contract Address

Finally, retrieve and verify the contract address:

```bash
CONTRACT_ADDR=$(mantrachaind query tx $INIT_TX_HASH $NODE --output json | jq -r '.events[] | select(.type == "instantiate").attributes[] | select(.key == "_contract_address").value')
echo "Contract address: $CONTRACT_ADDR"
```

![21.4.webp](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/5.%20Implementing%20Functions%2C%20Contract%20Managem/3.%20Bringing%20Your%20To-Do%20List%20to%20Life%20Creatin/21.4.webp?raw=true)

### Important Note

Once you have the contract address, copy it and paste it into the `.env` file located in the `building-on-MANTRA-chain/interface/` directory. This address will be needed for future interactions with your smart contract.

## Interacting with the Frontend

To start our frontend, navigate to the `interface` directory, install all dependencies using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`, and then run the development environment using `npm run dev`.

```jsx
cd interface
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
