## Revisiting the Cosmos Ecosystem

In the first course of the MANTRA Chain learning track, we took an in-depth look at the Cosmos ecosystem, the foundation upon which MANTRA Chain is built. As a quick refresher, let's revisit the key concepts of this innovative blockchain network.

### What is the Cosmos Ecosystem?

Imagine a universe of interconnected blockchains, each with its own unique strengths and features, working together seamlessly. That's the Cosmos ecosystem. It's a network of independent blockchains that communicate and share data, creating a more scalable, flexible, and interoperable blockchain landscape.

### Key Elements of the Cosmos Ecosystem

Here are the key elements of the Cosmos ecosystem.

- **Cosmos SDK:** A powerful framework for building custom blockchains. Think of it as a set of Lego blocks that developers can use to create their own unique blockchain applications.
- **CometBFT:** The heart of the Cosmos ecosystem, providing a robust consensus mechanism that ensures network security and data integrity.
- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC):** The secret sauce that enables different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem to communicate and share data. It's like a universal translator for blockchains.
- **CosmWasm:**  This smart contract platform leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) to bring flexibility and security to the Cosmos ecosystem. It allows developers to write smart contracts in various programming languages, making it easier to build powerful decentralized applications (dApps).

By understanding the Cosmos ecosystem, you're gaining a solid foundation for your journey into CosmWasm development on MANTRA Chain. Now, let's unlock the power behind this development by diving into the fascinating world of WebAssembly (Wasm)!

## Before CosmWasm: The Smart Contract Challenge

Imagine building a house where everyone speaks a different language. The plumbers only know French, the electricians only speak Spanish, and the carpenters only understand Japanese. Communication would be a nightmare, right? You'd spend more time deciphering each other than actually building the house!

This is a bit like the situation with smart contracts, different blockchain platforms have their own unique languages and environments, making it difficult for developers to write code that could work across multiple blockchains. This created a fragmented landscape where smart contracts were often isolated to specific platforms, limiting their potential reach and impact.

### Wasm: The Universal Language for Smart Contracts

Enter WebAssembly (Wasm). Just like a universal translator that allows people from different cultures to understand each other, Wasm provides a common language for smart contracts.

Think of Wasm as a universal language for the web, allowing different programming languages to work together seamlessly. It enables developers to code in different languages like Rust, C++, or Go, then compile it into a universal format(Binary Instruction Format - a series of low-level instructions (like 0s and 1s)) that any blockchain can understand and execute. With Wasm, you can write your code once and deploy it across multiple blockchains, making smart contracts incredibly portable, reusable, and accessible

### Wasm in the Cosmos Ecosystem

Now, let's bring this back to the Cosmos ecosystem. Remember how Cosmos is all about creating a network of interconnected blockchains? Well, Wasm plays a crucial role in making this vision a reality. By providing a common execution environment for smart contracts, Wasm enables flexibility and portability within the Cosmos ecosystem.

This means that developers can write smart contracts in a language like Rust, compile them into Wasm, and deploy them on any blockchain that supports CosmWasm. While Wasm itself doesn't directly enable interoperability between blockchains, it standardizes how smart contracts are executed. This standardization is crucial for the Cosmos ecosystem because it facilitates smoother interactions and integrations between different blockchains.

In summary, Wasm allows smart contracts to be more portable and versatile across the Cosmos ecosystem, enhancing the ability for blockchains to interact and share functionality.

## Cosmos + Wasm = CosmWasm

![MANTRA C2 Image 2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Building%20on%20Mantra%20-%20C2/1.%20Introduction%20to%20CosmWasm/2.%20Cosmos%20and%20Wasm%20=%20CosmWasm/MANTRA_C2_Image_2.webp?raw=true)

Yes, as already hinted by the heading, CosmWasm is the Cosmos (Cosm) way of utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), hence its name. It's a smart contract platform designed to bring flexibility, speed, and security to decentralized applications (dApps).

CosmWasm allows developers to write smart contracts in familiar programming languages, like Rust, and then compile them into Wasm bytecode. This bytecode can run on any blockchain that supports the Cosmos SDK, making it incredibly versatile and portable. By leveraging Wasm, CosmWasm ensures that smart contracts execute quickly and securely, meeting the high standards  for blockchain applications.

**But why do we need CosmWasm?** Why not use Wasm directly? The answer lies in the need for a specialized platform that integrates seamlessly with the Cosmos SDK. While Wasm provides a universal execution environment, CosmWasm adds tools, libraries, and support to make Wasm practical for blockchain development. CosmWasm handles the specifics of blockchain interactions, making it easier and more efficient for developers to create and deploy smart contracts within the Cosmos ecosystem.
