# What Are We Building Today?

Hey there, MANTRA masters! 👋

Welcome back to the exciting world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world assets (RWAs)! We're stoked you conquered our first course and are ready to level up your MANTRA Chain skills.  🎉

Blockchain tip: Following project repos on GitHub isn't just about code - it's your ticket to the inner circle. From airdrops to early access, the perks of being an engaged community member can be surprising. Why not start by following [MANTRA's GitHub](https://github.com/MANTRA-Finance)?

In this course, we're not just dipping our toes; we're diving headfirst into the world of building decentralized applications (dApps) on MANTRA Chain. Think about it: fractional ownership of real estate, art, commodities, and more—all enabled by the secure, transparent infrastructure of MANTRA Chain, designed to foster compliant tokenization and trading. This course is your toolkit for turning these possibilities into reality!

Remember all the awesome stuff we covered in the first course? The Cosmos ecosystem, the ins and outs of RWAs, the importance of regulatory compliance, and MANTRA's vision to merge TradFi and DeFi, its architecture? Well, this course builds on that foundation, empowering you to create dApps that truly leverage the power of MANTRA Chain.

## The To-Do dApp: Your Launchpad to CosmWasm Mastery

But why build a to-do dApp, you ask? Well, get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the real-world action of blockchain development! This seemingly simple app is your launchpad into the exciting world of CosmWasm development on MANTRA Chain.

Here's why this to-do dApp is more than just checking off tasks:

- **Hands-On Learning:** Building a to-do dApp is the most hands-on and engaging way to grasp the core concepts of CosmWasm. You'll learn by doing, creating a working application from scratch.
- **Rust Fundamentals:** You'll dive into the world of Rust, the powerful and secure language that fuels CosmWasm. By building this dApp, you'll gain valuable experience with Rust syntax, data structures, and functions, setting the stage for more complex projects in the future.
- **Deployment and Interaction:** The thrill of coding doesn't end on your local machine. You'll deploy your dApp onto the MANTRA testnet, interacting with it in a real blockchain environment. This hands-on experience will give you a taste of what it's like to bring your decentralized creations to life.

Building a to-do dApp might seem like a small step, but it's a giant leap towards mastering the MANTRA Chain and unleashing your potential as a blockchain developer. So, let's get started on this exciting journey!
