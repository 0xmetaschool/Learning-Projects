# Get Started With OpenAI API

Welcome back, folks! We’re so proud that you’ve set up the front end. Let’s first go through the OpenAI API and understand what it is. Then at last try to set up the environment variable for OpenAI API.

### The OpenAI API: Your Chatbot's Backstage Pass to ChatGPT

Think of the OpenAI API as a VIP pass that grants your chatbot exclusive access to ChatGPT's inner circle. With just a few lines of code, you can send prompts to ChatGPT and receive its mind-blowing responses in real-time, all within your application. It's like having a direct line to the AI oracle, ready to answer your every question and fulfill your every command.

This opens up a whole new world of possibilities! You can build chatbots that answer customer questions with lightning speed, generate creative content that'll leave your audience in awe, translate languages like a pro, and so much more, all powered by the sheer brilliance of ChatGPT. The API is the key to unlocking the full potential of this AI powerhouse and integrating it seamlessly into your projects.

**Key Features:**

- **Text Generation**: Create text based on prompts or previous conversation history.
- **Conversational AI**: Build chatbots and interactive applications.
- **Customizable**: Tailor responses based on specific roles or instructions.

In this project, the OpenAI API will be used to power a conversational agent that provides personalized advice and guidance in the context of love and relationships.

### How Will the OpenAI API Be Used in This Project?

In this project, the OpenAI API will:

- **Receive User Input**: Process text input from users seeking relationship advice.
- **Generate Responses**: Use the model to generate thoughtful and reflective responses based on the user's context and previous interactions.
- **Stream Responses**: Provide real-time interaction by streaming responses back to the user.

## Set up the environment variables

Now, we need to set up the environment variable. So, follow the following steps to get everything ready.

### Create `.env` file

First, create a `.env` file in the front-end project, `dating-ai-bot-app`, and paste the following.

```
JWT_SECRET=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
MONGODB_URI=
```

Now, let’s fill these variables one by one.

### Fill in `OPENAI_API_KEY`

First of all, we need to create and export the OpenAI API key so that we can access and use the OpenAI APIs with ease. 

**Note:** Before generating the key, OpenAI might ask you to buy the paid version to access the key. So, you’ll have to pay for the subscription to smoothly work with OpenAI API.

Follow the following steps to create a new key.

1. Head over to the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

1. Click on the “+ Create new secret key” button and enter your phone number if you haven’t entered it at the time of sign-up.

2. Next, name your API key and click on the “Create secret key” button.

3. At last, copy the API key generated and paste it into the `.env` file.

## That’s a wrap

We will use these keys as we progress in the course and implement the dating app code. So, stay tuned and keep on building.
