# Get Started With MongoDB

Welcome back, folks! Great work on setting up the API key for OpenAI API. This time we will set MongoDB so that we can keep track of the users’ information in our Next app. 

Let’s first understand what exactly is MongoDB and then dive into setting it up.

## What exactly is the MongoDB?

MongoDB is like the cool, flexible friend of databases! Instead of squeezing data into rigid rows and columns like a traditional SQL database, MongoDB lets you store data in a more laid-back, flexible format called **documents**. These documents are stored in **collections**, and each one looks a lot like a JSON file.

Why is this cool? Well, imagine you're building an app, and you don’t know exactly what kind of data you'll need in the future. MongoDB says, "No worries!" You can add data on the fly, without worrying about sticking to a rigid structure.

For example, if you’re saving user info, you might not always know if every user has a middle name or a phone number. In MongoDB, you can store different types of data for each user and not worry about empty fields or predefined structures.

Here’s an example of what a document (think of it as a row in SQL) looks like in MongoDB, stored in a collection (think of it as a table):

```json
{
  "name": "Jhon",
  "age": 25,
  "profession": "Web3 Engineer",
  "hobbies": ["content writing", "coding", "blogging"],
  "contact": {
    "email": "jhon@example.com",
    "phone": "123-456-7890"
  }
}
```

In this example, we’ve got a lot of freedom. The document stores all sorts of data types: strings, numbers, arrays, and even embedded documents (like "contact"). MongoDB loves this kind of flexibility!

So, in short, MongoDB is a non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data in a dynamic, flexible way, perfect for modern applications where your data might evolve.

## Why MongoDB?

As discussed in the last example, saving user information is very smooth in MongoDB. So, we’re using MongoDB to save the user data in our dating application.

## Set up the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable

To fill in this environment variable, follow the following steps.

1. Head over to the [Mango DB Altas](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/cloud/atlas/try4?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_core_prosp-brand_gic-null_emea-pk_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624545&adgroup=115749719183&cq_cmp=12212624545&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw0aS3BhA3EiwAKaD2ZUvxnVzqEPYz56u76SszW7lsgs6OGskGNUkQp7kRzxE8fDSwVcGPtxoCdBwQAvD_BwE) website and sign up.

2. After signing up you will see a page like this.

3. Create a new project by clicking on the “Project 0” field. Follow the steps in the following GIF.

4. Next, click on the “Access Manager” and head over to the project you just created.

5. Head over to the Database field from the navigation bar and click on the “+ Create” button to create a cluster.

6. After clicking the deployment, the new pop-up will be displayed. Follow the following steps and finally create a cluster. **Note: Please copy the password shown on the first page, we will use the password in the URI.**

7. Wait for some time to finish the connection.
8. Lastly, click on the “Connect” button and copy the connection string.

9. Paste the connection string in the `.env` file and replace the `<db_password>` with the password you copied in the last step.

## That’s a wrap

Phew! Great work on setting up the MongoDB. Next, we will set up the last environment variable.
