# Installing Required Tools

Welcome back, folks!! Before building our very first dating bot, we need to set up our system and ensure everything is ready and installed to build the app smoothly. So, in this lesson, we will make you go through the tools you need to install in your system to build the dating chatbot.

## Tool Time: Gathering your gear

Before we dive into the coding fun, we need to gather some essential tools. Think of it like prepping your ingredients before baking a cake – you can't make deliciousness without the right stuff!

1. **Node.js & npm (or yarn):** Node Js is the engine that powers your JavaScript code, even outside a web browser. This is super important for blockchain development because it allows you to create and execute code that will interact with the OpenAI APIs directly from your computer. npm (or yarn) is your trusty package manager. It's like a shopping cart for code libraries, making installing and managing all the software components your project needs easy.
    - **Download & Install Node.js:** Head to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The installer will also include npm (or you can choose to install yarn separately). Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you're not sure which one to choose, npm is a great starting point.
    - **Verify Success:** Open your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following commands:
        
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        
        (If you're using yarn, run `yarn -v` instead of `npm -v`)
        
    
    You should see version numbers for both Node.js and your package manager printed out. If you do, congrats! You've successfully installed Node.js and your package manager.
    
2. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** This is our code editor of choice. It's a free, powerful tool that makes writing JavaScript code a breeze. It's got a clean interface, tons of customization options, and a huge library of extensions to help you code like a pro.
    - **Download & Install:** Grab it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the simple installation instructions.
3. **Python:** Head over to the [Python downloads official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Python specific to your OS.
4. **Git:** Grab it from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.
5. **Git CLI:** It allows you to connect with git via the terminal, so let’s install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, and type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git. You might need to enter your GitHub password if you have yet to log in.

## Setting up your project

Head over to the following repo and clone it.

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/dating-ai-bot-app.git
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/dating-ai-bot-app.git
git checkout boilerplate_01
```

This is your initial NextJS app. Run it using the following command.

```
cd dating-ai-bot-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

And you will see an output at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). For now, I’ll just say change the light and dark mode, we will make it functional as we proceed with the lessons.

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, you set up the installments and the git repository. In the next lesson, you will set up the necessary environment variables for our app.
