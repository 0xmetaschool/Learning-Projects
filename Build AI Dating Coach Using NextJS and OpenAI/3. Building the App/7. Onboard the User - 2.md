# Onboard the User - 2

Awesome job so far! We have gone through the necessary files for our onboarding of the user flow. Well, in this lesson, we will discuss another important flow that is super helpful in navigation of using the files we have define ed in our previous lesson.

## authContext.js

Navigate to the `contexts/authContext.js`. Let’s understand more in detail what this file has for us. 

This file is like your very own **Duke of Hastings** (from the famous *"I burn for you"* scene). The Duke, much like this code, is tasked with deciding who gets to enter his heart (your app).

- **AuthContext** is the Duke’s unwavering dedication—constantly keeping track of who is worthy (logged-in users).
- When a new suitor (user) arrives, the Duke checks if they possess a token of trust (token in `localStorage`). If they do, he carefully considers their background (fetches user info). Only if their intentions are true (valid token and completed onboarding) will the Duke allow them closer to him (the dating assistant).
- **Login** is the Duke declaring his love ("I burn for you"), granting them full access to his heart (saving the token and redirecting).
- **Logout**? That's when the Duke, with great reluctance, must sever ties and send them away (removing the token and redirecting them home).

In essence, the file ensures that only those who truly "burn for you" (authorized users) get access, and it’s ever so selective, just like the Duke himself!

### Setting up the Authentication Context

```jsx
const AuthContext = createContext();
```

- Creates a context to store and manage authentication-related data (like user info) across the app.

### AuthProvider Component

```jsx
export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const router = useRouter();
  const toast = useToast();
```

- **`user` & `loading` state**: Manages the user data and loading state.
- **`router` & `toast`**: Used to navigate between pages and display notifications.

### Check for User on App Load (`useEffect`)

```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadUserFromToken() {
      const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
      if (token) {
        try {
          const response = await fetch('/api/user', {
            headers: {
              'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
            }
          });
          if (response.ok) {
            const userData = await response.json();
            setUser(userData);
            if (!userData.onboardingComplete) {
              router.push('/onboarding');
            }
          } else {
            localStorage.removeItem('token');
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error loading user:', error);
        }
      }
      setLoading(false);
    }
    loadUserFromToken();
  }, [router]);
```

- Checks if a token exists in `localStorage` when the app loads.
- If a token is found:
    - Fetches user data from the server.
    - Sets the user state.
    - Redirects to the **onboarding** page if onboarding isn't completed.
- **Handles errors** if the token is invalid or the user cannot be loaded.

### Login Function

```jsx
const login = async (token, userData) => {
  localStorage.setItem('token', token);
  setUser(userData);
  if (!userData.onboardingComplete) {
    router.push('/onboarding');
  } else {
    router.push('/dating-assistant');
  }
};

```

- **Stores the token** in `localStorage` after login.
- Sets the user data in state.
- **Redirects** the user to either the onboarding page or the dating assistant depending on their progress.

### Logout Function

```jsx
const logout = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('token');
  setUser(null);
  router.push('/');
};

```

- **Removes the token** from `localStorage` to log the user out.
- Clears the user state and redirects to the home page.

### AuthComponent for Login Handling

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
const AuthComponent = (props) => {
  const handleAuth = async (token, userData) => {
    await login(token, userData);
  };

  return <AuthPage onAuth={handleAuth} {...props} />;
};
```

- **Handles authentication** when the user logs in, using `AuthPage`.
- Calls the `login` function when login is successful.

### Providing Context to Children Components

```jsx
return (
  <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout, loading, AuthComponent }}>
    {children}
  </AuthContext.Provider>
);

```

- Makes authentication-related data and functions (`user`, `login`, `logout`, `loading`, and `AuthComponent`) available to all child components through the `AuthContext`.

### Helper Hook for Accessing Context

```jsx
export function useAuth() {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
}
```

- A helper function to easily access the `AuthContext` in other components.

Let me sum it up for you! `authContext.js` makes sure users are logged in and navigates them smoothly between pages! The code manages the authentication flow (login, logout, and checking for an existing user) and provides easy access to this functionality throughout the app via context.

You can find the complete code [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/dating-ai-bot-app/blob/boilerplate_02/contexts/authContext.js).

## Onboarding.js

Navigate to the `pages/onboarding.js`.

This **OnboardingPage** is like preparing for a grand ball in *Bridgerton*—a three-step journey to ensure you're ready for the romance ahead, with LoveGuide as your personal coach.

- **Step by Step:** Just like getting fitted for your ball gown or suit, you go through three stages: sharing your age, gender, and interests, with each detail bringing you closer to the perfect match.
- **Token of Invitation:** Right from the start, the page checks for your invitation (token), ensuring you're an authenticated guest. If you don't have one, you’re kindly redirected to sign in.
- **Submit and Celebrate:** Once you’ve provided all the details, it's like you’ve made your grand entrance! The app sends your info to the backend, and if all goes well, you’ll get a congratulatory toast message. If not, you get a polite nudge to try again.

In true *Bridgerton* fashion, the whole process is smooth and elegant, leading you gracefully into the world of LoveGuide with every detail handled to perfection!

You can find the complete code [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/dating-ai-bot-app/blob/boilerplate_02/pages/onboarding.js).

git add .
git commit -m "the user is onboarded successfully"
git push
```

## Wrap-Up

And there you have it! We have created a sign-in and sign-up flow for our dating application. In further lessons, we will be building more interesting features. So see you then!
