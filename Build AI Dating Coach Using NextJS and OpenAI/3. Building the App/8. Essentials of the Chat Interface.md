## Git Checkout

Let’s check out the right repo that we need for this lesson.

```
git checkout origin/boilerplate_03
```

## Message.js

Navigate to `models/Message.js`.

This **MessageSchema** in MongoDB is like a record of all the whispered secrets and exchanged letters between the user and their trusty *Bridgerton* assistant.

- **userId:** This is like attaching a wax seal to each letter, showing who sent it.
- **role:** Specifies if the letter is written by the user (our *Bridgerton* hero/heroine) or the assistant (their matchmaking confidante), ensuring we know who said what.
- **content:** This is the heart of the message, the actual words of advice, questions, or romantic musings.
- **timestamp:** Every letter is time-stamped, like marking the date on a journal entry, to track when each message was sent.

This schema elegantly organizes all your conversations, just like keeping a neat correspondence between yourself and your trusty dating assistant!

## Conversation History

This code is like fetching the latest gossip (conversation history) between the *Bridgerton* lead (user) and their *Lady Whistledown* assistant (AI).

Navigate to `pages/api/conversation-history.js`.

- **connectDB:** Ensures our social circle (database) is all set up for the latest updates.
- **authenticate:** Only those properly invited (authenticated users) get to see the juicy details.
- **GET method:** When the user requests it, this retrieves the last 50 conversation exchanges, sorting them by the latest gossip first.
- **Message.find:** This looks for all the messages linked to the user's ID, but only grabs the latest snippets.
- **Response:** It delivers the sorted history, showing just the roles (who said what) and the message content (what was said), skipping the timestamps for simplicity.

In essence, this is like pulling out a bundle of the last 50 love letters to reminisce on the advice and flirtations exchanged with the dating coach!

## Handler

This code is like hosting a quick tea party where the server (host) only allows a chat for a maximum of 30 seconds—keeping it short and sweet.

Navigate to `pages/api/handler.js`. Let’s understand what this code has for us.

- **`config` (maxDuration):** Sets the rule that this function will only run for 30 seconds—our tea party ends promptly.
- **`handler` function:** The host (server) listens to what the guests (client) bring, such as:
    - **`body`:** The actual message or gossip they’ve written down (data sent in the request body).
    - **`query`:** Any additional tidbits they mention on the side (query parameters).
    - **`cookies`:** The snacks they brought from their last visit (browser cookies).

Once all the info is collected, it sends it back with a *"Thank you for attending!"* in the form of a JSON response.
