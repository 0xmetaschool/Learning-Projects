# Onboard the User - 1

Awesome job buddy! We are done with the necessary setup. Now it’s time to dive into page navigation and much more. So, let’s get started! 

## Git Checkout

Let’s check out the right repo that we need for this lesson.

```
git checkout origin/boilerplate_02
```

## Onboard the User

Why is all of this crucial? I am sure you know how love is always in the air for the Bridgerton Ball. Well, dearest gentle reader, we will use the same analogy to explain our love coach here. Don’t be shy and let’s begin!

![Frame 3560425.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20AI%20Dating%20Coach%20Using%20NextJS%20and%20OpenAI/L6%20-%20Onboard%20the%20User%20-%201/Frame_3560425.gif?raw=true)

Just like the Duke’s exclusive dance card, the login/signup pages make sure every suitor (user) is recognized and given the personal attention they deserve. By gathering basic details, the AI dating coach can tailor advice to fit each user's unique profile. It’s also about making sure the journey to love stays private and secure, because discretion is key, darling.

We have a few important files here:

- **Signup:** Like getting your name on the guest list—hashes your password and creates your profile in the database, then hands you a JWT ticket to the love ball.
- **Login:** Confirms you're invited by checking your credentials and gives you a fresh JWT for the evening.
- **User:** Retrieves your personal details so the AI coach knows exactly who it’s wooing, minus the private stuff (password).
- **Onboarding:** Helps you complete your transformation—updating your age, gender, and interests—before declaring you fully ready for the dating game.
- **AuthContext** is the Duke’s unwavering dedication. It creates a simple and fun way to manage user authentication across your app!
- **User.js:** This schema helps the Duke (your app) keep detailed records of all suitors (users) and their progress in the grand pursuit of love (or in your case, using the app)!

That sums up our process of onboarding the user. Let’s dive into the details of it!

## Signup.js

Navigate to `pages/api/signup.js`.

The handler extracts `name`, `email`, and `password` from the request body and checks if a user with the same email already exists. If an existing user is found, it returns a 400 error. If not, it hashes the password using `bcrypt` (so no one can sneak in), creates a new `User` document with the hashed password and default `onboardingComplete` status set to `false`, and saves the user to the database. After saving, it generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the user's ID which is like a golden invitation to enter the party., set to expire in one day, and returns it along with the newly created user's details (excluding the password). If any errors occur, a 500 error response is sent. For unsupported request methods, a 405 error is returned.

## Login.js

Navigate to `pages/api/login.js`.

This file defines an API endpoint that handles user login through `POST` requests. It first connects to the database using `connectDB` and then extracts the `email` and `password` from the request body. The handler checks if the user exists in the database by searching for their email. If found, it verifies the password using `bcrypt` to compare the hashed password. Upon successful authentication, it generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the user's ID, set to expire in one day. It sends you into the main ballroom (your profile or dating page). The token, along with basic user info (excluding the password), is returned in the response. If the credentials are invalid, a 401 error is returned. For unsupported request methods, a 405 error is sent, meaning if you don’t pass, you’re gently escorted out.

## User.js

Navigate to `pages/api/user.js`. Think of this as your private dossier. This file retrieves all the juicy details about you (minus the secret ones, like passwords). The AI coach uses this to provide customized love advice. If the Duke doesn’t recognize you (user not found), you’ll be told with a polite 404 message.

It defines an API endpoint that handles authenticated `GET` requests to retrieve user information. It uses the `authenticate` middleware to ensure the request comes from a logged-in user. Once authenticated, it connects to the database using `connectDB`. The handler fetches the user's data by their `userId`, excluding the password for security, and returns it as a JSON response. If the user is not found, a 404 error is sent. In case of any server error, it returns a 500 error with details. The endpoint only supports `GET` requests, rejecting other methods with a 405 status.

## Onboarding.js

Navigate to `pages/api/onboarding.js`. This is your makeover scene. Here, you fill in your age, gender, and interests to complete your profile. Once done, you’re officially ready to join the AI dating ball with everything set for the perfect matchmaking experience.

This file defines an API endpoint for completing a user's onboarding process through `POST` requests. It uses the `authenticate` middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint. Once authenticated, it connects to the database using `connectDB`. The handler retrieves `age`, `gender`, and `interests` from the request body and updates the user's profile using `User.findByIdAndUpdate`, marking `onboardingComplete` as `true`. If the user is successfully updated, it returns a success message along with the updated user details. If the user is not found, a 404 error is sent. For any server errors, a 500 error response is provided. The endpoint only accepts `POST` requests, rejecting others with a 405 status.

## User.js

Navigate to the `models/User.js`.

This code is like the **Duke of Hastings’ diary**—carefully noting down details about each of his suitors (users).

- **Name, email, and password?** That’s how the Duke keeps track of who they are (their identity and login details).
- **Age, gender, and interests?** These are the finer details the Duke likes to know about each suitor—what they’re like, and what they fancy.
- The **onboardingComplete** field is the Duke’s way of knowing if they’ve truly earned his trust (finished onboarding), with `false` by default, because not everyone can win his heart on the first try!

So, this schema helps the Duke (your app) keep detailed records of all suitors (users) and their progress in the grand pursuit of love (or in your case, using the app)!

## Wrap-Up

And there you have it! We have understood the sign-in and sign-up flow for our dating application. In the next lesson, we will implement another important file and then interact with the frontend to see if this works! Excited?
