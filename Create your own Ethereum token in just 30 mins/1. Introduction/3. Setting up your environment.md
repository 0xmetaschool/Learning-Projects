# Setting up your environment

In the previous lesson you got the overview of this whole course but in this lesson we will setup the environment before getting started with the coding part (next lesson), for that we need to setup our metamask with the Sepolia RPC so let's go get that,

## First, What is a RPC?
So RPC is like a communication to blockchain which allows you to read/write on the blockchain, in short, a RPC is like a communication gateway for any blockchain

I hope that's clear for you so let's go and add this RPC to our metamask.

Let's go to [Metaschool RPC for Sepolia](https://metaschool.so/rpc/sepolia)

Click on "add to metamask" and confirm the transaction and that's it SEPOLIA is added to your metamask

## Letâ€™s get some FREE ETH TokensðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘

We will be using Testnet environment to create our own tokens.

### What is a testnet?

A testnet is a version of a blockchain network that is used for testing purposes. It is essentially a copy of the main network, but it uses a different set of rules, and it is separate from the main network so that developers can experiment with new features without affecting the main network. Testnets are often used by developers to test new software or to test out new transactions before they are sent to the main network. Because testnets are not connected to the main network, they are not subject to the same rules and regulations, and they can be freely experimented with without any risk to the main network.

For every transaction on blockchain, we need a native token of that blockchain, since we are building on Ethereum chain, we will need ETH tokens. So letâ€™s get some fake money.

- Now go toÂ [https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
- Sign in with your metamask wallet
- Now you will see an option to request LINK token and ETH token on Sepolia network, Make sure to select ETH token out of the two
- After this login with your Twitter to verify yourself
- Finally you need to complete the Captcha and click on send request

Now you will have some ETH tokens in your account to pay for the transaction fees, guys we are just 10 mins away from creating our token! Excited, right?

So, we finished setting up everything we need for the deployment, letâ€™s do some coding now! I will help you create your own token contract in just 5 lines!! NO JOKE!
