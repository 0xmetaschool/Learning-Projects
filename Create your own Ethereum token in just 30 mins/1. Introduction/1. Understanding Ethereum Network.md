# Understanding Ethereum Network

Hey fam 👋🏼

I’m Aswin and today we will learn about creating your own Ethereum token in 30 mins, and it will be a step-by-step process.

I will name my token as 🥭 Mango Coin and of course you can have your own name as per your choice.

So, I guess we are good to go, hold tight because we will have a working token ready in the next 30 minutes. 🔥

But before we start, we need to understand a few things and I promise it won’t be some history class lecture!

## What is Ethereum Network?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that creates a peer-to-peer network for safely executing and validating smart contract application code. Participants can do business with one another using smart contracts without the need for a reliable central authority.

## What makes Ethereum one of the safest networks?

Ethereum has the highest number of validators making it hard to plan an attack on this network.

So let’s get started who knows if your coin becomes the next Aave, Safemoon, etc.

See, that wasn't boring! 😎

Now let's move on to the next lesson. Hope you're excited!
