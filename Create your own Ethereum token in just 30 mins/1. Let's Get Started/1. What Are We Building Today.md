# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ðŸŒž, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about building the blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So, what are we building today? Today we will learn how to create your own Ethereum token in 30 mins. It will be a simple, step-by-step process.

Why Ethereum? Ethereum is the first blockchain that offers developers to code and create applications on Ethereum blockchain. It is decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. Ethereum uses EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to run the code and uses Solidity as native programming language.

Not only this, the count of developers working in Ethereum is the highest with 5,758 number of developers as of 2022. That makes 16% of developer working on Ethereum in crypto ecosystem.

And Metaschool wants you to be part of this great ecosystem and make change in the world thatâ€™s why weâ€™re here today with a great course.

## Course overview

We will cover:

- How to create an ERC20 token like Shiba Inu, Safemoon, Aave, etc
- How to use OpenZeppelin library
- How to use QuickNode to create your dApp
- How to deploy on Ethereum Testnet

**Keep your momentum going! In lesson 3rd and 4th, weâ€™ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I canâ€™t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about building their own blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain ecosystem and [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/) because in this course we will focus more on building your own blockchain and skip the theory part.

## Prerequisites

But that is not where it ends. In order to launch your cryptocurrency on Ethereum Network, you must also be familiar with several tools and have them installed on your machine.

- Remix IDE - to write and deploy our code
- OpenZeppelin - Ethereum Network supports EVM so we will use ERC-20 standards
- MetaMask - to interact with the Ethereum Network
- Some ETH tokens - which we can get from the faucet

**Donâ€™t worry!** We will walk you through all tools and important installations in upcoming lessons. This is just the overview of the tools we will be using in the course.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
