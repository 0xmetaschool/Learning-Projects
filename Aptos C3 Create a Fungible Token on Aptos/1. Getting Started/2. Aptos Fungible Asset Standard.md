# Aptos Fungible Asset Standard

Hey there, everyone! We're thrilled to see your enthusiasm for learning with us! Let's dive right in and explore the Aptos Fungible Asset Standard that we'll use to build our contract. Get ready for an exciting journey of discovery!

## Fungible Tokens (FTs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Let’s learn the most famous tokens in web3 space:

- **Fungible Tokens (FTs):** In blockchain lingo, fungible tokens are like digital coins where every coin is identical and interchangeable. Think of them like dollar bills or arcade tokens—same value, same properties!
- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):** NFTs are unique digital treasures stored on a blockchain. Unlike fungible tokens, each NFT is one-of-a-kind and can't be duplicated. They're perfect for representing collectibles, artworks, or even real-world items.

The Aptos blockchain supports the creation of both types of tokens using the following standards:

1. **Aptos Fungible Asset Standard** for regular tokens, tokenized real-world assets, and in-game assets
2. **Aptos Digital Asset Standard** for NFTs: It is an advanced Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard for Aptos. NFTs, which represent unique on-chain assets, are organized into collections. These NFTs can be modified, transferred, soulbound, burned, or mutated through custom smart contracts.

These standards use Move's object model, making it a breeze for developers to work with and speeding up app development. By treating assets as objects, developers can easily add custom properties and save them as resources.

## Aptos Fungible Asset Standard

The Aptos Fungible Token standard defines a set of rules and guidelines for creating fungible tokens on the Aptos blockchain. It essentially acts as a blueprint for developers to ensure their tokens adhere to specific functionalities and interoperability within the Aptos ecosystem.

### Key Aspects

The key aspects of these asset standards are:

- **Resource-Based Design:** Tokens are represented by resources stored on the blockchain, ensuring uniqueness and preventing accidental deletion.
- **Supply Management:** Functions for minting (creating new tokens) and burning (destroying tokens) give developers control over the token supply.
- **Transferable:** A `transfer` function makes sending and receiving tokens within the Aptos network easy.
- **Metadata Support:** Optional metadata can store extra information about the token, like its name and description.
- **Security:** The standard leverages Move's safety features, including access control and resource ownership validation, ensuring secure transactions.
- **Interoperability:** Promotes seamless integration of tokens across different contracts and DeFi applications built on Aptos.
- **Frozen state:** The creator of fungible assets can freeze the interchange of fungible assets.

## Deep Dive Into FA Standard

All the resources defined in the Aptos FA standard are included in the object resource group and stored inside objects. There are two types of objects related to FA:

- **Object\<Metadata\>**: Include information about the FA, such as name, symbol, and decimals.
- **Object\<FungibleStore\>**: Store a specific amount of FA units. FAs are units that are interchangeable with others of the same metadata.

Don’t worry! We will get into these terms and it will be so easy for you to understand and implement them. 

## Metadata Object

The `Metadata` struct defines the properties that describe a fungible asset type:

```
struct Metadata has key {
    supply: Option<Supply>,
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    decimals: u8,
}
```

- `supply` (optional): Total number of tokens in existence (if applicable).
- `name`: Human-readable name of the asset (e.g., "META Coin").
- `symbol`: Shorter abbreviation for the asset (e.g., "META").
- `decimals`: Number of decimal places for display purposes (e.g., 2 for cents).

## Fungible Asset

The Aptos fungible asset standard introduces a concept called Fungible Assets (FAs). These FAs act like temporary containers holding information about a specific type and amount of fungible tokens.

## Fungible Store

Since FAs are temporary, Aptos relies on another concept called Fungible Stores for long-term storage and management of fungible tokens. The Fungible store is responsible for storing a specific amount of FA. These stores act like bank accounts for your tokens, keeping track of the total balance and frozen state for a specific asset type.

### More into the FungibleStore

Each `FungibleStore` object has an owner. However, an owner may possess more than one store. Let’s say Alice wants to send some FA to Bob, how does she determine the correct destination? Additionally, what happens if Bob doesn't have a store yet?

To address these questions, the standard has been expanded to define primary and secondary stores.

1. **Primary Fungible Store:** It is responsible for the main storage responsible for core functionalities of the fungible asset. It references Metadata for asset details and is linked to Alice as the owner, enabling her to perform operations like transferring tokens, minting, or burning.
    - Each account owns **only one non-deletable** primary store per FA type.
    - The address is derived deterministically from the account address and metadata object address using the sha256 hash function.
    - If a primary store does not exist, it is created automatically when FA is deposited.
2. **Secondary Fungible Store:** It manages additional functionalities beyond basic asset management. It references Metadata for consistency in asset details and is linked to Alice as the owner, allowing her to use extended functionalities for complex scenarios like DeFi etc.

The Owner, Alice owns and controls both the Primary and Secondary Fungible Stores, conducting operations like sending and receiving tokens and managing secondary stores for advanced use cases. 

The different objects involved - Object<Metadata> and Object<FungibleStore> objects, and their relationships to accounts are shown in the diagram below:

### References

The Aptos Fungible Asset standard introduces a powerful concept called "References" (refs) for implementing granular permission control. Think of refs as special tokens that grant specific abilities. These abilities can be used to mint new tokens, transfer existing ones, or even burn them (destroy).

**Types of References:**

The FA standard defines three distinct types of refs:

- **MintRef:** Grants the ability to mint new tokens of a specific asset type (metadata).
- **TransferRef:** Allows for transferring existing tokens, even if the asset type is frozen (deposits/withdrawals disabled).
- **BurnRef:** Grants the power to burn (destroy) existing tokens.

**How it Works:**

- Each ref holds a reference to the metadata object, which identifies the specific fungible asset type it applies to.
- Owning a particular ref allows you to perform specific actions:
    - **MintRef:** You can mint new tokens of the associated asset type.
    - **TransferRef:** You can transfer existing tokens of the asset type, bypassing any freeze restrictions.
    - **BurnRef:** You can burn (destroy) existing tokens of the asset type.
