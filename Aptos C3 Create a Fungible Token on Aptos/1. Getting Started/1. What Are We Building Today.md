# What Are We Building Today

GM everyone! ☀️ We’re super excited to kick off the third course in our detailed series on Aptos for developers here on Metaschool. First things first, let’s give you a big round of applause for completing the first two courses on Metaschool Woohoo! 🎉

Did you know? Active participants in blockchain communities often stumble upon unexpected rewards. It all starts with staying engaged – like following [Aptos' repos](https://github.com/aptos-labs) on GitHub.

Aptos is a layer-1 blockchain with **3.9M+** monthly active users and **983M+** transactions as of the writing date. Aptos has over **170+** projects ranging in various domains like DeFi, NFT Tooling, Gaming, Wallets, Stablecoins, Marketplaces, and many more. We know that your project has to be the one on Aptos too and we're thrilled to help you build on this platform. 

We have already talked about features like the resource-oriented structure, Block STM, Aptos Standards, and the Move programming language, and we built a Calculator dApp in our first two courses. Now it’s time to build a fungible token and learn to interact with it. Just for your excitement, we have added a GIF that shows how we will interact with our token. Yesss~

## The Aptos Move Token Contract

But why build a token contract, you ask? Buckle up, because here's why:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Writing a contract is an engaging and practical way to grasp Aptos blockchain concepts like Aptos Fungible Asset Standard.
- **Deployment and Interaction:** The excitement doesn't stop at coding! You'll deploy your contract onto Aptos, interact with it on the Explorer, and see your code come to life in a decentralized environment.

### Features of the token contract

This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build the **following functionalities** of a token contract on Aptos Move:

- **mint:** Creates new tokens of a specific type.
- **transfer:** Sends existing tokens from one account to another.
- **burn:** Destroys existing tokens, taking them out of circulation.
- **deposit:** Moves tokens from a temporary holding area to a permanent storage account.
- **withdraw:** Moves tokens from a permanent storage account to a temporary holding area.
- **freeze_account:** Disables deposits and withdrawals for a specific fungible asset type in an account.
- **unfreeze_account:** Enables deposits and withdrawals for a previously frozen fungible asset type in an account.

## Course Overview

We will:

1. A quick run through the Aptos Fungible Asset Standard.
2. Get your tools and workspace ready for development.
3. Build the foundations of the contract
4. Add functionalities like mint, transfer, burn, withdraw, and more
5. Deploy and Interact with the Token Contract on Aptos Testnet Explorer

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner level Web3 developers who wish to learn about Aptos and have completed our first two courses on Aptos. You should have basic programming knowledge as it will help you have a quick start to this course but if not, we are here for you!

## What will you be getting out of this course?

As a developer, you will be getting the following outcomes when you complete this course:

1. Utilize Move to build on Aptos
2. Build Token Contract on Aptos
3. Claim your NFT upon course completion

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with us, you will get a special NFT which will unlock many more opportunities on the Metaschool platform. Here is what the NFT looks like.
