# Build the Foundations

Welcome back! You have been doing great and we are proud of you! In the previous lesson, we have set up our project.

In this lesson, we will be diving into the core components that establish the groundwork for our fungible token contract on Aptos. We'll explore the imports, define a struct, and unpack the `init_module` function responsible for initializing the token. We will then examine the `get_metadata` function and wrap up this section.

![block.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-aptos-c3/Section%203%20Build%20Your%20Token/Lesson%205%20Build%20the%20Foundations/block.webp?raw=true)

## Imports and Constants

Before we dive into imports and constants, let's discuss modules. In Move, a module functions similarly to a "class" in other programming languages. It packages everything a Move smart contract requires, including imports, variables, and functions. Here in our case `aptos_asset::fungible_asset` module provides the necessary functionalities to create fungible tokens within the Aptos ecosystem. We import functionalities like `MintRef`, `TransferRef`, and `BurnRef` to manage the minting, transferring, and burning of our token units, respectively. Additionally, imports from `aptos_framework` grant access to core functionalities like object management and fungible asset utilities.

The module also defines constants such as `ENOT_OWNER`, which represents an error code for non-owner access attempts, and `ASSET_SYMBOL`, which specifies the symbol for the fungible asset.

Okay enough talking let's get our hands dirty with some code. Navigate to the `create-fungible-token-on-aptos/sources/fungible_asset.move` and add the following code:

```
module aptos_asset::fungible_asset {
    // Importing the necessary modules
    use aptos_framework::fungible_asset::{Self, MintRef, TransferRef, BurnRef, Metadata, FungibleAsset};
    // Importing functionalities for fungible assets, including self-reference, minting, transferring, burning, metadata, and fungible asset utilities.

    use aptos_framework::object::{Self, Object};
    // Importing object management functionalities, including self-reference and object handling.

    use aptos_framework::primary_fungible_store;
    // Importing the primary fungible store module.

    use std::error;
    // Importing standard error handling functionalities.

    use std::signer;
    // Importing functionalities for handling signers.

    use std::string::utf8;
    // Importing functionalities for UTF-8 string manipulation.

    use std::option;
    // Importing functionalities for handling optional values.

    /// Only fungible asset metadata owner can make changes.
    // Constants
    const ENOT_OWNER: u64 = 1;
    // Error code indicating that the action is not allowed because the user is not the owner of the fungible asset metadata.

    const ASSET_SYMBOL: vector<u8> = b"META";
    // Symbol for the fungible asset, represented as a vector of bytes.

    #[resource_group_member(group = aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
    /// Hold refs to control the minting, transfer and burning of fungible assets.
    struct ManagedFungibleAsset has key {
        mint_ref: MintRef, // Reference for minting assets
        transfer_ref: TransferRef, // Reference for transferring assets
        burn_ref: BurnRef, // Reference for burning assets
    }
}

```

Now we know all these can be a bit overwhelming for you, so let us walk you through the code and explain each block!

## ManagedFungibleAsset

The `ManagedFungibleAsset` struct serves as a crucial element in our contract. It acts as a container, holding references to three essential functionalities:

- `mint_ref`: This reference grants permission for minting new tokens.
- `transfer_ref`: This reference authorizes transfers of existing tokens between accounts.
- `burn_ref`: This reference allows burning (destroying) existing tokens.

By encapsulating these references within a struct, we maintain a clear separation of concerns and ensure proper access control for each operation.

```
struct ManagedFungibleAsset has key {
        mint_ref: MintRef,
        transfer_ref: TransferRef,
        burn_ref: BurnRef,
    }
```

## init_module function

The `init_module` function plays a pivotal role in initializing the token contract. Here's a breakdown of its key actions:

1. **Object Creation:**
    - It establishes a named object using `object::create_named_object` and assigns it the symbol defined in `ASSET_SYMBOL`. This object serves as the central storage for our token's metadata.
2. **Metadata Initialization:**
    - The function leverages `primary_fungible_store::create_primary_store_enabled_fungible_asset` to configure the primary store for our fungible asset. This store maintains the token balances for each account.
    - It then defines various metadata details like name, symbol, decimals, icon URL, and project URL.
3. **Reference Generation:**
    - The function generates separate references (`mint_ref`, `burn_ref`, and `transfer_ref`) for minting, burning, and transferring tokens, respectively.
    - It retrieves the signer associated with the newly created object using `object::generate_signer`.
4. **Resource Initialization:**
    - Finally, it assigns the generated references to the `ManagedFungibleAsset` struct and stores it within the metadata object using `move_to`. This establishes the initial state of our managed fungible asset resource.
    

Here is how the code looks like:

```
fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
    // Create a named object for the asset using the admin signer and the asset symbol
    let constructor_ref = &object::create_named_object(admin, ASSET_SYMBOL);

    // Create the primary store for the fungible asset with the specified metadata
    primary_fungible_store::create_primary_store_enabled_fungible_asset(
        constructor_ref,
        option::none(), // No specific options
        utf8(b"META Coin"), // Name of the asset
        utf8(ASSET_SYMBOL), // Symbol of the asset
        8, // Number of decimals
        utf8(b"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFm-kF6O3onxPgFJ_rVLh9YGFT_fFWM6/view?usp=sharing"), // Icon URL
        utf8(b"http://metaschool.so"), // Project URL
    );

    // Create mint, burn, and transfer references to allow the creator to manage the fungible asset
    let mint_ref = fungible_asset::generate_mint_ref(constructor_ref);
    let burn_ref = fungible_asset::generate_burn_ref(constructor_ref);
    let transfer_ref = fungible_asset::generate_transfer_ref(constructor_ref);

    // Generate a signer for the metadata object
    let metadata_object_signer = object::generate_signer(constructor_ref);

    // Move the managed fungible asset to the metadata object signer's account
    move_to(
        &metadata_object_signer,
        ManagedFungibleAsset { mint_ref, transfer_ref, burn_ref }
    ); // Initialize the managed fungible asset
}

```

## get_metadata function

The `get_metadata` function serves a simple yet vital purpose. It retrieves the address of the object that holds our token's metadata. This address can be used for various purposes, such as interacting with the contract's functions that require access to the metadata.

```
public fun get_metadata(): Object<Metadata> {
        let asset_address = object::create_object_address(&@aptos_asset, ASSET_SYMBOL);
        object::address_to_object<Metadata>(asset_address)
    }
```

## Complete Code

Here’s what the final code we wrote till now looks like:

```

module aptos_asset::fungible_asset{
    use aptos_framework::fungible_asset::{Self, MintRef, TransferRef, BurnRef, Metadata, FungibleAsset};
    use aptos_framework::object::{Self, Object};
    use aptos_framework::primary_fungible_store;
    use std::error;
    use std::signer;
    use std::string::utf8;
    use std::option;

    /// Only fungible asset metadata owner can make changes.
    const ENOT_OWNER: u64 = 1;

    const ASSET_SYMBOL: vector<u8> = b"META";

    #[resource_group_member(group = aptos_framework::object::ObjectGroup)]
    /// Hold refs to control the minting, transfer and burning of fungible assets.
    struct ManagedFungibleAsset has key {
        mint_ref: MintRef,
        transfer_ref: TransferRef,
        burn_ref: BurnRef,
    }

    /// Initialize metadata object and store the refs.
    // :!:>initialize
    fun init_module(admin: &signer) {
        let constructor_ref = &object::create_named_object(admin, ASSET_SYMBOL);
        primary_fungible_store::create_primary_store_enabled_fungible_asset(
            constructor_ref,
            option::none(),
            utf8(b"META Coin"), /* name */
            utf8(ASSET_SYMBOL), /* symbol */
            8, /* decimals */
            utf8(b"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFm-kF6O3onxPgFJ_rVLh9YGFT_fFWM6/view?usp=sharing"), /* icon */
            utf8(b"http://metaschool.so"), /* project */
        );

        // Create mint/burn/transfer refs to allow creator to manage the fungible asset.
        let mint_ref = fungible_asset::generate_mint_ref(constructor_ref);
        let burn_ref = fungible_asset::generate_burn_ref(constructor_ref);
        let transfer_ref = fungible_asset::generate_transfer_ref(constructor_ref);
        let metadata_object_signer = object::generate_signer(constructor_ref);
        move_to(
            &metadata_object_signer,
            ManagedFungibleAsset { mint_ref, transfer_ref, burn_ref }
        )// <:!:initialize
    }

    #[view]
    /// Return the address of the managed fungible asset that's created when this module is deployed.
    public fun get_metadata(): Object<Metadata> {
        let asset_address = object::create_object_address(&@aptos_asset, ASSET_SYMBOL);
        object::address_to_object<Metadata>(asset_address)
    }    
}
```

Make sure your `create-fungible-token-on-aptos/sources/fungible_asset.move` file is updated with the latest code and then in your opened terminal, run the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## That’s a wrap

In essence, using a struct resource in this context offers a structured approach for managing the essential references required for operating our fungible token contract. This concludes our lesson. Congratulations!! By understanding these core concepts, you've laid a solid foundation for building a functional token contract on Aptos.
