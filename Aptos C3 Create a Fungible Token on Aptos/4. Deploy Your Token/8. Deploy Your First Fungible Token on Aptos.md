# Deploy Your First Fungible Token on Aptos

Time to reap the rewards of all our hard work and finally deploy our contract! üéâ With everything set up, it's time to bring our token to life on the blockchain. Let's dive in and make it happen!

## Deploying the contract

To deploy our token, we first need to set up the `Move.toml` file. So, head over to the `Move.toml` file in the root directory and replace the contents with the configurations given down below. Make sure to replace `<Replace-with-your-wallet-address>` with your wallet address.

```
[package]
name = 'MyToken'
version = '1.0.0'

[dependencies]
AptosFramework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework", rev = "testnet" }
AptosStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib", rev = "testnet" }
AptosToken = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-token", rev = "testnet" }
AptosTokenObjects = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-token-objects", rev = "testnet" }

[addresses]
aptos_asset = "<Replace-with-your-wallet-address>"
std = "0x1"
aptos_std = "0x1"
aptos_framework = "0x1"
aptos_token = "0x3"
aptos_token_objects = "0x4"
```

Next, compile the contract using the following command:

```
aptos move compile
```

Finally, deploy our token contract using the following command:

```
aptos move publish
```

Type ‚Äúyes‚Äù when the command asks if you want to pay for the transaction. And Viola! you have successfully deployed your token contract onto the Testnet üí™.

## Interacting with the contract

Follow these steps to Mint some ‚ÄòMeta‚Äô coins using your token contract using Aptos Explorer:

- Navigate to [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=testnet) and connect your wallet to the explorer.

- Enter your wallet address in the search bar to view the details of your wallet.
- Under the Modules section, select the Run panel. This will show all the functions we can get executed.
- Select the `mint`function from the side panel, now enter your own address under `arg0` and specify the number of tokens you want to mint under `arg1`. Click run and authorize the transaction when prompted.

You will now be able to view your newly minted coin under the Coin Section ü™ô.  Let‚Äôs transfer some of our ‚ÄúMeta Coins‚Äù to another wallet address.

- Select the `transfer` function under the Run panel.
- Specify your wallet address under `arg0` and the wallet address of the 2nd account to whom you‚Äôd want to share your tokens under `arg1`.
- Enter the amount of Meta Coins you‚Äôd want to transfer under `arg2`.
- Click run and authorize the transaction when prompted.
