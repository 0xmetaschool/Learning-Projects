# Set Up the Token Project on Move

Alright Guys! let's get things rolling by setting up our Token project . We'll dive right in using the same tried and tested steps from our previous course. By the end of this setup, we'll be ready to hit the ground running and start implementing our Token. 

## Aptos CLI

Aptos CLI is pretty much like a Swiss-army knife when it comes to being able to develop and interact with the Aptos blockchain. But before we get into why the Aptos CLI is so important, let’s set some context on why we need a CLI in the first place.

### Why Do We Need a CLI?

When you're developing on the Aptos blockchain, you've got tasks like creating accounts, working with smart contracts, managing keys, and setting up nodes. Doing all this by clicking around in a graphical interface takes forever and can lead to mistakes. A CLI or Command line interface makes it easy, you just type commands to get things done fast. It’s all about getting things done efficiently. 

### The Importance of Aptos CLI

The Aptos CLI is your go-to tool for developing and interacting with the Aptos blockchain. It’s designed to simplify a wide range of tasks, making your development process smoother and more efficient. If you want a glimpse of all operations Aptos CLI can do for you, then run the command in your terminal to see all the commands available at your disposal.

```
aptos --help
```

The CLI provides a variety of commands that cover all aspects of interacting with the Aptos blockchain. Here are some of the key commands you’ll be using:

- **account:** Tool for interacting with accounts. This includes creating new accounts, checking balances, and managing account-related activities.
- **config:** Tool for managing the configuration of the Aptos CLI tool. It helps you set up and modify settings to suit your development environment.
- **genesis:** Tool for setting up an Aptos chain Genesis transaction. This is essential for initializing the blockchain network.
- **governance:** Tool for on-chain governance. It allows you to participate in governance activities, like voting on proposals.
- **info:** Shows build information about the CLI. Useful for checking the version and other details about your CLI installation.
- **init:** Tool to initialize the current directory for the Aptos tool. Sets up the necessary files and structure for your project.
- **key:** Tool for generating, inspecting, and interacting with keys. Essential for security and identity management.
- **move:** Tool for Move related operations. Move is the smart contract language used by Aptos, and this command helps you compile, publish, and interact with Move modules.
- **multisig:** Tool for interacting with multisig accounts. Multisig accounts require multiple signatures for transactions, adding an extra layer of security.
- **node:** Tool for operations related to nodes. This includes starting, stopping, and managing blockchain nodes.
- **stake:** Tool for manipulating stake and stake pools. Useful for participating in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

Using these commands, you can efficiently manage and develop on the Aptos blockchain. The CLI is a powerful ally in your development toolkit, providing the flexibility and control you need to build and maintain your blockchain applications.

## Your Move project

Before setting up, we have some pre-requisites to do. Let’s complete those:

1. **Git:** Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. It's like a time machine for your code!
    - **Download & Install:** Grab it from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.
2. **Git CLI:** It allows to connect with git via so let’s install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your favorite terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git by entering your GitHub password.
        6. Do not close this terminal!

Awesome, you are all set!! Good job!

### Initialize the project

In the same terminal where you configured your Git CLI, run the following command:

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/create-fungible-token-on-aptos.git --clone 
```

This will clone the boilerplate code of your project onto your system and fork the repository to your Git account as well. Now run this command:

```
cd create-fungible-token-on-aptos
```

The next thing we need to do is set up our Aptos CLI to work with our account. We'll use the `aptos init` command inside our directory.

1. You’ll be prompted to choose a network when you run the above command. Type `testnet` and press Enter.
2. Next, provide your private key we copied in the last lesson when prompted and hit enter.

And there you have it! The Aptos CLI is successfully set up.

## That’s a wrap

We've successfully set up our Move project to start implementing our Token Contract. In the upcoming lesson, we'll be adding essential components to our Move file to prepare our Token for minting!
