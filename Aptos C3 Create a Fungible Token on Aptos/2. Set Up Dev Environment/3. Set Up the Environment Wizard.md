# Set Up the Environment Wizard

Hey there, welcome back! You've been crushing it so far, understanding the Aptos Fungible Asset Standard. Now, it's time to take the next step and set up our development environment with all the necessary dependencies.

> **Well, if you have already installed the Petra wallet and Aptos CLI, skip to the next lesson after completing the assignment.**
> 

## Setup Petra Wallet

1. Download the [Petra Aptos Wallet Chrome extension](https://petra.app/).
2. Click the “Create New Wallet” button.
3. Create a password and securely store your recovery phrase, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

( Pin the Petra Aptos Wallet extension to your taskbar, coz we’ll be needing it quite often )

## Change the network

We will be deploying our code to the Testnet, so we need to change the network to which our wallet is connected. Follow the steps given below to change it:

1. Go to “Settings” which is at the bottom right corner.
2. Click on the “Network”.
3. Select “Testnet”.

And with this, we have successfully changed the network.

## Copy the essentials

There are two key essential pieces of information that you’ll require quite often for the purpose of development and deployment. 

1. Wallet Address 
2. Private Key 

Follow the steps given below to copy and save these:

1. Go to “Settings” which is at the bottom right corner.
2. Scroll down and go to “Manage account”.
3. Enter the password for your Petra wallet and click on Next.
4. Copy the wallet address and save it somewhere secure.
5. Click on “Show” under the Private key.
6. Copy the private key and save it somewhere secure.
- Make sure to NEVER SHARE the private key with anyone. This is very private info and if someone gets access to it, they can hack into your account easily. So stay careful and safe!

## Fund the wallet

Here we have another important step to do and that is to fund the wallet. We need money to deploy our code so let’s ask for some fake money. Aptos deals in APT coins.

Click on the “Faucet” button and you will get 1 APT. Well, we clicked it twice to get 2 APT 😇.

## Installation on System

I’ll tell you step-by-step installation for your operating system (OS) which might be Mac, Linux, or Windows. So, opt for the OS you are using, and follow the steps. 

### Installation on Mac

![Frame 3560400 (2).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-aptos-c3/Section%202%20Set%20Up%20Dev%20Environment/Lesson%203%20Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/Frame_3560400_(2).webp?raw=true)

1. First, you need a `brew` package. The `brew` allows you to install the packages on Apple easily. Open a terminal on your Mac and run the following command. It will ask for your laptop’s password, provide it, and continue with the installation.
    
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
    
2. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
    
    ```
        brew update
        brew install aptos
    ```
    
3. Now restart the terminal or open another terminal and run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
    
    ```
       aptos help
    ```
    

How easy was it~

### Installation on Linux

![Frame 3560401 (1).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-aptos-c3/Section%202%20Set%20Up%20Dev%20Environment/Lesson%203%20Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/Frame_3560401_(1).webp?raw=true)

Before starting, just a little heads up: The set of instructions that we’ll discuss are of Ubuntu-based systems and anyone using a different Linux distribution can use their native package managers to install the same dependencies.

Open the terminal and run the following command to install the package. It will ask for your laptop’s password so provide it.

```
sudo install apt-get
```

Aptos peeps suggest that the best and easiest way to install the Aptos CLI tool is through Python script. So let’s install it by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python
```

It will install the latest version of the python. You need a 3.6+ version. You can verify it using **`python --version`. 

Next, you have to ensure that you can use Python in every terminal so to do that you add the path where Python is installed to an environment variable called `PATH`. The variable `PATH` instructs Linux to the directories where it can search for the packages.

So let’s add Python to your `PATH`:

- Run `which python`, it tells where python has been installed on the system i.e., it gives you the path.
- Now run `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/python` to add the python path to your variable.
- Now install `curl` and then install Aptos CLI using the following commands:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install curl
    curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
    ```
    
- Or you can use `wget` which is a tool to download the files from the internet from the terminal directly. You can install Aptos CLI using the following commands:
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install wget
    wget -qO- "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
    ```
    
- Now restart the terminal or open another terminal and run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
    
    ```
       aptos help
    ```

### Installation on Windows

![Frame 3560399 (1).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-aptos-c3/Section%202%20Set%20Up%20Dev%20Environment/Lesson%203%20Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/Frame_3560399_(1).webp?raw=true)

You can install the Aptos CLI using the python. So first install Python by following the steps given:

1. Visit the [Python website and download the package](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) according to your system architecture.
2. Check your Downloads folder to see the package. 
3. Install the package and you’re set up for python.

Now follow the steps given below to install the CLI:

1. Open PowerShell using the Start Menu.
2. Run the following command:
    
    ```
    iwr "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" -useb | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | python3
    ```
    
3. The command’s output will show you a command to set the `PATH` variable, make sure to run it.
4. Run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
    
    ```
       aptos help
    ```
    

## That’s a wrap

Whew! We’ve conquered the installation phase, and now it’s time to dive into the fun stuff! Get ready because in the next lesson, we’re rolling up our sleeves to create a project for our fungible token. Let’s bring those coding dreams to life!
