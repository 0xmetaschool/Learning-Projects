# Set Up Starkli, Scarb, And ArgentX

Welcome to the fantastic realm of Starknet development! So we completed leaning about Starknet and Cairo programming language. In this exciting chapter, we're going to take you on a journey through the process of setting up your very own Starknet development playground. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is development environment?

We now need a super cool environment to run our code in and we need to set it up!

For this tutorial, we will use Starkli, Scarb, ArgentX wallet, and then StarkScan for navigating the network. Don‚Äôt worry, setting them is super easy and you will do it no time!

## What are Starkli and Scarb?

Both are necessary development framework for building and deploying smart contracts on the Starknet network.

- You can interact with Starknet using **Starkli** which is a command-line based interface.
- You can utilize **Scarb** to manage the package of Cairo. Scarb assists in compiling cairo smart contracts to Sierra, an intermediate language.

### Starkli installation

You can install Starkli environment using `Starkliup` with the help of following command:

```
curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
```

Restart the terminal and then run the following command:

```
starkliup  -v 0.1.20
```

Restart the terminal again and then run the following command:

```
starkli --version
```

Your version will look like this:

### Scarb installation

Scarb can be installed on all major operating systems like macOS, Linux, and Windows. 

For Windows, you can follow the manual steps mentioned [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download#install-via-installation-script). Windows user should also install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

For macOS and Linux users, kindly open a new terminal and run the following command:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 0.6.1
```

Restart the terminal and verify your Scarb installation by running the following command:

```
scarb --version
```

Your version will look like this:

## Build project

Now let‚Äôs create a folder using mkdir command, I am using name `metaschoolStarknet`:

```
mkdir metaschoolStarknet
```

Now change the directory to `metaschoolStarknet`:

```
cd metaschoolStarknet
```

Run the following command to initialize Scarb project:

```
scarb init
```

I have opened my folder in Visual Studio and my project directory looks like this:

Incase you already have installed the most recent version of `starkli`, after running the `scarb init`, you will be given two options just like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fccc3b3c-de6a-440f-8afe-881dceffa87c)

Just go ahead and pick the first one (`Starknet Foundry (default)`), as that is what we need for building a smart contract for Starknet using cairo.

Now let‚Äôs move on to ArgentX setup‚Ä¶

## Setup ArgentX

It is one of most popular wallet and only-freely available wallet on Starknet.

You can add it easily using browser extension. For chrome, just go to [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/argent-x/dlcobpjiigpikoobohmabehhmhfoodbb/related) link and then add to chrome.

Once you add ArgentX extension to Chrome, you will be redirected to new page. Click on create a new wallet, accept terms and conditions and then add your password. Your wallet will be created, easy-peasy, isn‚Äôt it üï∂Ô∏è

Now, your ArgentX will look something similar to what‚Äôs shown below.

## Getting some tokens

Now, it's time to get some test tokens, so we can deploy our contracts on Starknet.

Here's a simple step-by-step guide:

- Open your Argent X wallet.
- Change the network to Testnet, it‚Äôs usually located in the top right corner. It will ask you to create an account for testnet. so upon creation, your network will be set to Testnet.

- Now, you need to copy your account address from your wallet. It's like copying your home address to receive something.

- Go to [https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/) using your web browser. This is a special website that helps you get some test tokens for your Testnet account. Connect your wallet and hit the Send Request button.

- Now, all you have to do is wait for the transaction to complete. Check your wallet after around 5 mins, you will see at least 0.002 amount credited to your wallet.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned about setting up a development environment for running our code. We used Starkli, Scarb along with Argent X for wallet interactions and a faucet to get some tokens.

In the next lesson, we will finally start writing the code of ERC20 token.
