# Deploy Your First ERC20 Token on Starknet

Welcome back! So we have completed writing our ERC20 token. You did great! In this lesson, we will dive into deploying your token to Starknet blockchain by running commands in the terminal. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Updating files

### Update `Scarb.toml`

Update the `Scarb.toml` as follows:

```
[package]
name = "starknetmetaschool"
version = "0.1.0"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest

[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.0.1"

[cairo]
sierra-replace-ids = true

[[target.starknet-contract]]
sierra = true
```

This configuration file sets up our project named `starknetmetaschool`. It specifies dependencies, including the `starknet` library, and applies Cairo-specific settings for handling smart contracts. Additionally, it enables Sierra compatibility for the StarkNet contract target.

### Update `lib.cairo`

Go to `src` folder and replace the existing content of `lib.cairo` with the following:

```
mod erc20;
```

## Build your contract

Open the terminal and run the following command to build your contract: 

```
scarb build
```

The output of this command will be similar to what is shown below:

After this you will be able to see that a new folder named `target` is also created.

## Setting up wallet to deploy contract

First run the following command to create a folders `starkli-wallets/deployer`, so we can save our private data:

```
mkdir -p starkli-wallets/deployer
```

### Get your private key

Now we need to export the private key of your account. Enter your password of the wallet and then copy your private key.

![Frame 3560339 (1).gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Frame_3560339_(1).webp?raw=true)

- **Warning: Do not share your private key with anyone! It’s superrr private!!!**
    
    

Now run the following command:

```
starkli signer keystore from-key starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
```

It will ask for your private key, paste the one you copied above. Then enter your password. **Make sure to remember your password, this will be required every time you make a transaction. We will use it while declaring our contract.** It will generate `keystore.json` file in `starkli-wallets/deployer/` folder. The output of the command is shown below:

### Get your wallet address

Now open your wallet, copy your account address, and save it! This is our ArgentX account address. We are going to need it for our next steps. 

![Frame 3560365 (2).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Frame_3560365_(2).webp?raw=true)

Alchemy is used to connect to the blockchain because we cannot run the nodes by ourselves so we use their service. So let’s head over to [https://www.alchemy.com/](https://www.alchemy.com/) and sign up or sign in to Alchemy. Follow the steps given below to create an app and fetch its URL:

1. After logging in, you’ll be able to see a dashboard. On the left-hand side navbar, you can see “Apps”; click on it.
2. Now click on the “Create new app” button present on the right-hand side. You’ll be able to see a pop-up.
3. Select “Starknet” in Chain.
4. Select “Starknet Goerli” in Network as we want to deploy our contract to testnet.
5. Name your app.
6. Click on “Create app”.

![Screen Shot 2023-12-29 at 12.48.26 PM.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Screen_Shot_2023-12-29_at_12.48.26_PM.webp?raw=true)

Completing these steps will create the app. Now click on the API key on the right-side top corner.

![Screen Shot 2023-12-29 at 12.55.59 PM.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Screen_Shot_2023-12-29_at_12.55.59_PM.webp?raw=true)

Copy the HTTP URL which you will be using in the next step. 

Head back to your terminal of `metaschoolStarknet` folder. Run the command given below after replacing `<Alchemy_Startknet_URL>` with the URL you copied:

```
export STARKNET_RPC=<Alchemy_Startknet_URL>
```

Run the command given below after replacing "<SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS>" with your ArgentX wallet address to save all of our account info:

```
starkli account fetch <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> --output ./starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
```

It will generate `account.json` file in `starkli-wallets/deployer/` folder. The output of the command is shown below:

For me now the `account.json` file looks like this:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "variant": {
    "type": "argent",
    "version": 1,
    "owner": "0x141d0d0aacbabed376089a2ef888b2658ec7be807d32a452caa3bb8600bcef2",
    "guardian": "0x0"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "status": "deployed",
    "class_hash": "0x1a736d6ed154502257f02b1ccdf4d9d1089f80811cd6acad48e6b6a9d1f2003",
    "address": "0x7e08c15c50535758865a41c9e2084bd01d5827425ce5a3e72d8430ab0c94ca1"
  }
}
```

### Setting up your terminal

Now we will set up our terminal to be ready for deploying and declaring contracts using the following commands (make sure you are in `starknetMetaschool` directory):

```
export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=./starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json
export STARKNET_KEYSTORE=./starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json
```

## Declare your contract

Now you need to copy the **name** of your `seirra.json` file in `target/dev/` folder.

![Frame 3560365 (5).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Frame_3560365_(5).webp?raw=true)

Run the following command after replacing **<YOUR_FILE_NAME>** with your file name. Enter the password you set up when you provided your account’s private key while creating the `keystore.json` file.

```
starkli declare target/dev/<YOUR_FILE_NAME> --compiler-version=2.1.0
```

The output of the above command is shown below. Copy the class hash, we need it for deploying the contract.

![Screen Shot 2023-12-29 at 3.49.08 PM.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Screen_Shot_2023-12-29_at_3.49.08_PM.webp?raw=true)

## Deploy your contract

Run the following command after replacing:

- **<YOUR_CLASS_HASH>** with yours that you copied above.
- **<SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS>** with your ArgentX wallet address.

```
starkli deploy <YOUR_CLASS_HASH> <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> 379067928035501022078318 1346719813 18 1000000000000000 0
```

- `379067928035501022078318` is the hex of PEPE Token.
- `1346719813` is the hex of PEPE.
- `18` is the decimal value.
- `1000000000000000` is the amount to be minted.
- `0` is the salt value.

The output of the above command is shown below.

![Screen Shot 2023-12-29 at 3.51.01 PM.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Screen_Shot_2023-12-29_at_3.51.01_PM.webp?raw=true)

Your contract is deployed!!! You can go to the [StarkScan](https://testnet.starkscan.co/) transaction hash link. Paste the address before your contract deployed and check out its overview.

## Interacting with your contract

Go to **Read/Write Contract** to interact with your deployed contract. In the **Read** part, you can check the name, symbol, balance, etc of your account. I have queried to find the name of my token in the gif shown below.

![Frame 3560365.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_starknet/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Starknet%20%5Bupdated%5D/Frame_3560365.webp?raw=true)

To interact with the Write part of your contract, click on **Write** and connect your wallet.

After connecting, you can call any function. We have shown the interaction using `mint`:

A lil task for you is to try other functions too!

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we deployed an ERC20 token on the Starknet blockchain by running commands on the terminal. Now no-one can stop you to writing and deploying contracts on Starknet. Good luck with your future deployments!

Next, we will wrap up the course.
