# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ☀️! We are very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Starknet for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own ERC20 token in Cairo programming language and then deploying it on Starknet blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Starknet using Cairo.

Why Starknet? Starknet is a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum. Major applications such as MakerDAO, Aave and others are deploying contracts on Starknet and are putting resources into building on top of the platform. Moreover Alchemy, Argent, Infura, Ledger, and OpenZeppelin are taking part in building it.

Not only this, do you know Starkware the company behind Starknet created zk-STARK (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)? The same is famous for its security and privacy. Starknet offers eventual L1 security and it’s total value locked is $63.48 M.

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Starknet blockchain and Cairo
2. Set up ArgentX Wallet and local development environment
3. Deploy the Cairo smart contract on Starknet

## Who exactly should take this course?

This tutorial is for beginners who wish to learn about Starknet and how they can deploy smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of programming concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. These concepts will help you have a quick start to this course.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
