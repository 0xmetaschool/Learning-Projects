# What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone üåà, we are very excited to bring the exciting course for developers just like you, who want to get started with the NFTs ecosystem!

So what are we building today? Today I will be helping you create NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain using d token standards. To be precise, my focus will be on building NFTs using ERC-721, ERC-721A and ERC-1155 token standards.

Why NFTs? The technology provides a whole spectrum of opportunities to verify the genuineness and authenticity of a digital asset. It has given rise to a safe and sound business viewpoint around non-fungible assets. All thanks to the amazing blockchain technology behind it that the acceptance and adoption rate speaks for its verity itself.

Not only this, you can also earn money using NFTs. Around 5K NFTs are being sold daily as of April 2023. "The Merge" is the biggest authentic NFT sale to date that was sold for $91.8 million in December 2021.
