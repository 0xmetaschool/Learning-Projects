# Writing an ERC-721A Smart Contract

Much talking, huh? Let's get straight to the practical part of it. Let's look at how to code it.

The following code is derived from the official GitHub [repo](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/blob/main/contracts/ERC721A.sol) for ERC721A. Notice the _mint_ function now takes in _quantity_ instead of _tokenId._ Feel free to play around.

```reasonml

pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "erc721a/contracts/ERC721A.sol";

contract Azuki is ERC721A {
  constructor() ERC721A("Azuki", "AZUKI") {}
  function mint(uint256 quantity) external payable {
    // _safeMint's second argument now takes in a quantity, not a tokenId.
    _safeMint(msg.sender, quantity);
  }
}
```

Even simpler than the golden standard, no?
