# ERC-1155 â€“ One Above All

ERC-1155 is a brand-new token standard that strives to combine the finest features of prior token standards to build a fungibility-agnostic, gas-efficient token contract.

This standard eliminates the drawbacks and limitations of its predecessors and builds upon their success. The distinctive feature that makes it stand out is the fact that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple types of tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) at once.

The standard's blisteringly quick speed is one of its main selling factors. This speed is accomplished by combining many token IDs into a single transaction, allowing for rapid transfer of cash and tokens. This has a lower impact on the blockchain and speeds up transactions.

This method is very useful for applications that require a large number of tokens. Instead of creating separate contracts for each token type, a single ERC1155 token contract might include the whole system state, reducing deployment costs and complexity.

Although it looks quite similar to ERC-721 at an initial glance because it contains an extra id parameter for the identification of the token whose balance you wish to check.

But in ERC-721 and ERC-721A each token is NFT and it either exists or not. On the contrary, in ERC 1155 each token id has its own balance in an ERC1155 account, and non-fungible tokens are produced by minting a single one.
