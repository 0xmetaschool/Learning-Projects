# Creating an ERC-721 Contract with Open Zeppelin

If you're creating a smart contract then you obviously would want to make sure that it is surrounded by an ecosystem that takes complete precautionary security measures into account for your contracts. [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) exactly helps with that!

In this section, we'll try and figure out how to create an ERC-721 contract with OpenZeppelin.

Creating an ERC-721 Contract with Open Zeppelin is relatively simple. For development purposes, we will use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) as our IDE for writing, compiling, and deploying the contract. If you wish to jump directly to the complete smart contract, here is a copy of it.

```reasonml
// SPDX-License-Identifier:UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract Hellonft is ERC721("HelloNft", "HNFT") {
    uint tokenId;
    mapping(address=>tokenMetaData[]) public ownershipRecord;

    struct tokenMetaData {
        uint tokenId;
        uint timeStamp;
        string tokenURI;
    }

    function mintToken(address recipient, string memory url) public {
        _safeMint(recipient, tokenId);
        ownershipRecord[recipient].push(tokenMetaData(tokenId, block.timestamp, url));
        tokenId = tokenId + 1;
    }
}
```

Don't get too overwhelmed by looking at the entire contract upfront. This was just a quick snapshot. More details follow 😄

Let's get started with the step-by-step overview of this contract.

## Headers of the Contract

We will define the Solidity compiler version using pragma. We will also import the respective Open Zeppelin library from their official repo, namely, _Ownable_ _ERC721_. The ERC721 library includes the basic definitions for a contract to be rightfully ERC-721 standard:

```awk
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import “https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
```

## Body of the Contract

We will name our contract _Hellonft_ and inherit the Open Zeppelin library _ERC721_ into our contract

```csharp
contract Hellonft is ERC721(){}
```

We will now define the name and symbol of our contract in the ERC721 constructor as _HelloNft_ and _HFNT_, respectively

```wren
contract Hellonft is Ownable, ERC721(“HelloNft”, “HNFT”){}
```

The tokenId (unique identifier for each token) is initialized (to 0)

```abnf
uint tokenId;
```

A mapping is initialized with _key_ as _address_ and _value_ as _tokenMetaData_

```abnf
mapping(address=>tokenMetaData[]) public ownershipRecord;
```

The tokenMetaData struct is defined to keep tokenId, timestamp and tokenURI of each token in one place, so as to be connected to the ownershipRecord of addresses in a comprehensive way.

```csharp
struct tokenMetaData{
    uint tokenId;
    uint timeStamp;
    string tokenURI;
}
```

We will now write our _mintToken_ function. Minting in an NFT is the process of tokenizing an asset. In our case, we will mint a sample image and use its _URL_ as _tokenURI_.

Let's define our _mint_ function as _mintToken_. We pass in the _address_ of the _receiver_ (to whom to mint to) and the _url_ of the _asset_ (to _mint_) as parameters to our function:

```reasonml
function mintToken(address recipient, string memory url) public {}
```

We now start the minting process imported from the ERC721 contract using the _safeMint function and maintain our own ownershipRecords by pushing the \_tokenMetaData_ to the recipient.

```reasonml
_safeMint(receiver, tokenId);
ownershipRecord[recipient].push(tokenMetaData(tokenId, block.timestamp, url));
tokenId = tokenId + 1;
```

You may now proceed to deploy the contract on the Remix VMs or any other testnets and play around.

You might notice a plethora of available mutational and querying functions available from inherited contracts. For now, they are beyond the scope of this article but we will definitely deep dive more into them in our upcoming tutorials.

Call in the _mintToken_ function, pass in the _address_ (of the _receiver_) and _url_ (of the _asset_), and you will have tokenized your very first NFT.

You did it! You finally did it! You should be proud of making it this far.
