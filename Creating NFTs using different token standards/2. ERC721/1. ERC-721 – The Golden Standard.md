# ERC-721 â€“ The Golden Standard

In January 2018, William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs presented the ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comments 721) standard (aka the golden standard), which is considered the evergreen Non-fungible Token standard that specifies an API for non-fungible tokens within smart contracts.

The ERC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of token is unique and can have different value than another token from the same smart contract, maybe due to its age, rarity or even something else like its visual. Wait, visual?

Yes! All NFTs have a `uint256` variable called `tokenId`, so for any ERC-721 contract, the pair contract address, `uint256` `tokenId` must be globally unique. That said, a dApp can have a "converter" that uses the `tokenId` as input and outputs an image of something cool, like zombies, weapons, skills or amazing kitties!

Starting to get impressed with ERC-721 already? Hehe, hang on there's more.

## Definition of ERC-721 Smart Contract

Now that we have briefly discussed the contract itself, let's look at how it can be created.

Creating a smart contract that is ERC-721 compliant is fairly easy and is quite rewarding too. If a smart contract implements the following methods, it can be deemed as an ERC-721 (NFT) contract.

```reasonml
function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);

```

A fairly straight-forward interface, right? Now let's get to writing your contract.
