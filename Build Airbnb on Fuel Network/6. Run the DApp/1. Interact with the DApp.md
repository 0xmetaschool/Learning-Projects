# Interact with the DApp

Before starting this section, we would like to remind you that you have been doing great so far, and congratulations on reaching almost the end of the course. 

We will now be interacting with our DApp through the front end we created in earlier lessons. So, let’s get started. 

Firstly, you will need to connect your Fuel wallet to your dApp. This would allow you to carry out different actions and sign transactions according to your purpose.

You can see above that your wallet has now been connected to your dApp. Now let’s start with the more fun part. 

- Imagine you want to list a property for sale in our Blockstay dApp. You can simply do that by clicking on **List** and filling in the necessary details like so:

Here you need to upload your PIN code, and two images to be able to list a property. This would then be ready for booking. 

Lastly, we should also be able to book a property. You can do this by going to Book from where you will see different property options available. You can choose to reserve this by providing the dates.

## Wrap up

As a developer, one of the most exciting aspects of their work is seeing their products in live action. We hope you had lots of fun seeing the working of the dApp you created in real time. Do share with us the links to your dApp.
