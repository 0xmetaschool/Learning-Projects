# Create the Property Library

Now that you have already created your booking data structures, let’s go ahead and create a property data structure. Hold on tight as you are going to learn a lot in this lesson. 

The first data structure that we are going to build here is **property image**. Let's first try to understand what we want to achieve here and then we can start building it. 

The primary goal is to have the property image uploaded in a decentralized way. However, storing images on-chain is extremely expensive. But worry not, here’s when **IPFS** comes to our rescue. We will be storing our images on IPFS using something called Pinata. Well, I will come to this once we start working on the front end. So let’s get started: 

### property_image

Create a file called `property_image.sw` and write the following code: 

```
library;

/// Used to track the Listings that a user has created.
pub struct PropertyImage {
    /// images of the property.
    image1: b256,
    image2: b256,
}

impl PropertyImage {
    /// Creates a new Listing.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `id`: [u64] - The unique identifier for the Listing.
    pub fn new(image1: b256, image2: b256) -> Self {
        Self { 
            image1,
            image2,
         }
    }
}
```

This file creates the struct to store the images as b256 which is a 256 bit, hence you can store a hash of 32 characters. Once we upload the images to IPFS, we get something called CID which we will show you the demo of in the frontend section. We convert the CID here into the hash of 32 characters. We will get into more details in later sections. 

### property_info

Create a file called `property_info.sw` and write the following code:

```
library;

use ::data_structures::property_state::PropertyState;
use ::data_structures::booking_state::BookingState;

pub struct PropertyInfo {
    /// The user who has listed the Property
    owner: Identity,
    ///Pincode of the property
    pincode: u64,
    ///Listed or not
    listed: PropertyState,
    ///Availability
    available: BookingState,    
}

impl PropertyInfo {

    pub fn new(
        owner: Identity,
        pincode: u64,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            owner,
            pincode,
            listed: PropertyState::Listed,
            available: BookingState::Available,
        }
    }
}
```

This will create a struct for the property details like the pincode, owner, property state, and if the listing is available or not.  We internally create a storage to map to property id. 

### property

Create a file called `property.sw` and write the following code: 

```jsx
library;

/// Used to track the Listings that a user has created.
pub struct Property {
    /// The unique identifier for the Listing.
    id: u64,
}

impl Property {
    /// Creates a new Listing.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `id`: [u64] - The unique identifier for the Listing.
    pub fn new(id: u64) -> Self {
        Self { id }
    }
}
```

This file creates a struct for the `property_id` which will be similarly mapped to property info as `booking_info` that we looked at previously. 

### property_state

Create one more file called `property_state.sw` and paste the following code: 

```
library;
use core::ops::Eq;

/// Represents the current state of the Property.
pub enum PropertyState {
    Listed: (),
    Unlisted: (),
}

impl Eq for PropertyState {
    fn eq(self, other: PropertyState) -> bool {
        match (self, other) {
            (PropertyState::Listed, PropertyState::Listed) => true,
            (PropertyState::Unlisted, PropertyState::Unlisted) => true,
            _ => false,
        }
    }
}
```

This creates a struct for property states to track if the property is listed or not.

## That’s a wrap

Great work on completing the 2nd milestone of building your AirBnb dApp. Next, we will implement the events and errors handling features for our dApp.
