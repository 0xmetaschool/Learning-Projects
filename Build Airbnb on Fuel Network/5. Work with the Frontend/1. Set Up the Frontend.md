# Set Up the Frontend

Kudos! We have deployed our dApp and we are all set to proceed in setting up our frontend. No more waiting, let’s go!

## Clone the Airbnb frontend

Open a new terminal in your `airbnb-dapp` folder, outside of the `airbnb-contract` directory. 

Run the following command to clone the frontend directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate.git
```

## Set up environment variables

Now, after cloning the app, open the open in your IDE and find `.env` file. The .env file will look like this.

```
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ID=YOUR_AIRBNB_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ID
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=YOUR_PINATA_API_SECRET_KEY
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=YOUR_PINATA_API_KEY
```

Let’s go through how to fill these environment variables.

### Contract ID

In the last lesson, you must have copied the deployed contract ID. So, replace `YOUR_AIRBNB_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ID` with your contract ID here.

### Pinata API credentials

Next, we need Pinata API credentials. Follow the following steps to get one.

1. **Set up a Pinata account:** Head over to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create a free account.
    1. Click on the “Start Building” button. It will take you to the signup page.
    2. Enter your email address, select “Builder” in the title section, and move “Next.”
    3. Set your first name, last name, and password.
    4. Confirm your email by entering the confirmation code.
    5. Your Pinata profile is ready to go. Here’s what it will look like:

1. **Set up API keys:** Head over to the “API Keys” option from the sidebar. 
    1. Click on the “New Key” option.
    2. Write the key name. 
    3. Select the “Admin” option for the Scopes section.
    4. Lastly, simply click on the “Generate API Key” button. Here’s how we’re doing it.

After clicking on the Generate API Key” button. The page will appear that will display the “API Key” and the “Secret API Key”. Copy these keys and place them respectfully in the `.env` file.

## Install dependencies

Now, Move to the `fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate` folder and install the dependencies:

```
cd fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate
npm install
npm install buffer
npm install fuels@0.60.0 @fuel-wallet/sdk@0.13.0 --save
```

## Setup the ABI JSON files

Time to move our ABI JSON files to the front end of the `airbnb-contract` project. To do this, we will run the following command inside of the `fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate` folder. This command will execute the `fuel.config.ts` file.

```
npx fuels build
```

This will add the `contracts` folder to your `src`:

![contracts-folder.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend%20cb5951c7859846f484ce8a3fd6cf386f/contracts-folder.png)

## Run the frontend

Now run the following command to start your app:

```
npm start
```

You will see an output like this:

![fuel-c2-output.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_airbnb_fuel/Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend/fuel-c2-output.png?raw=true)

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we learned how to set up the front end for our dApp. We cloned the frontend directory, installed dependencies, and moved the ABI JSON files. Congratulations on completing this lesson and setting up your dApp's front end! Happy coding!

In the next lesson, we will interact with our dApp.
