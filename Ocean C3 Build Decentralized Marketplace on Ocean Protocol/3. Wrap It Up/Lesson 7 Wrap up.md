# Wrap up

Congratulations! You've completed customizing your marketplace. Yes, that’s awesome. You are cool!!!

## Building Your Own Marketplace

Here’s a quick recap of how to personalize your marketplace:

1. **Change the Marketplace Name and Logo**: We used VS Code’s search-and-replace feature to quickly update all instances of “Ocean Marketplace” with your marketplace’s new name.
2. **Customize the Styling**: Updated your color variables in `_variables.css` to apply your brand colors throughout the site for a cohesive look.
3. **Modify the Publish Form**: Changed the asset type label in `index.tsx` from “dataset” to “Photo” to make the form relevant to your marketplace’s focus on photos.

With these key customizations, your marketplace can be uniquely branded and ready for your audience!
