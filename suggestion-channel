i will like to make a suggestion on metaschool platform where we learn and improve our skills in web3 and blockchain at large 
1. make a mobile app or add a channel on the website or section that we can communicate with other devs on a particular course that we are learning/studiying right when we are learning
2. make it possible for a student to edit or even change his response to a submitted assignment after course completion or after moving to another topic or next lesson on that particular course this make it easy for the student in case they submit something wrong by mistake
3. make it possible for a student to submit multiple response not limited to uploading files and even submit text response along with file upload

and also i will like to know if i can help with the knowledge i acquire at metaschool to improve and make it no 1 learning hub for web3 and blockchain

thanks,
your student,
