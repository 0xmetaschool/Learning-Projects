# Upload Pokemon Cards to IPFS

Welcome back! Awesome job on learning the basics required to get started with minting the pokemon cards. In this lesson, you’re going to learn how to upload your Pokemon cards to IPFS. Don’t worry about creating the Pokemon cards because we will provide them. Of course you can make your own Pokemon cards as well.

First, let’s try to understand what exactly is IPFS then we will move forward on uploading the cards to IPFS.

## What is IPFS?

Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a special file storing system that represents the decentralized network implementation. With IPFS, you can directly share and access files with others using a secure and global peer-to-peer network.

In web ecosystem, HTTP is the primary file storage system that uses client server model where if the server get destroyed all of the data can get destroyed. Not only this, HTTP system have many other drawbacks that IPFS solves, but we will not discuss them in this course.

The main difference between centralized (HTTP) and decentralized (IPFS) storage systems is how data is stored and retrieved. The following diagram will help you understand this.

IPFS and blockchain are a perfect match! Because IPFS is decentralized too, just like blockchain, it's an awesome choice for storing and tracking files in a secure and distributed way.

IPFS generates a metadata for each file you upload and stores it in a json file, which makes each file secure. Each file has unique metadata and is accessible through the hash link. The hash link only shows the metadata to keep your data secure.

## Download Pokemon cards from GitHub

Before moving onto the next steps, kindly download the Pokemon cards that you will use to mint on Tezos blockchain.

1. Head over to this link: [https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/tree/main/assets/Pokemon Cards](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/tree/main/assets/Pokemon%20Cards)
2. Click on the png images one-by-one.
3. Then download them by clicking on the download button. Here I have highlighted the button in red box.

## Upload your Pokemon cards to IPFS

Lets follow the following steps one-by-one to upload your images to IPFS.

1. Go to [this](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/) website, download IPFS Desktop for your system and set it up. After the installation, the IPFS screen will look like this:

2. Go to the “Files” section on IPFS, click on “+Import” button present at right corner, select “File” from the scroll down and upload your Pokemon cards one-by-one to convert them to NFT.

3. Kindly make sure to upload both of the Pokemon cards to IPFS because in this course I will work with two cards and guide you to convert them to NFTs simultaneously.

## Copy CID

When you upload any file to IPFS, IPFS generates a cryptographic hash called CID. CID secures your image and helps to represent your image. CID is used wherever you need to access the image token. Follow the following steps to copy CID for your tokens.

1. Click and open the Pokemon card you uploaded on IPFS.
2. Click on “More” button and select “Copy CID” option.
3. Save CIDs somewhere. We will use them in the upcoming lessons.

Here’s me doing it for you.

## That’s a wrap

That’s pretty much it for now. Great work on uploading your Pokemon cards to IPFS.

One more lesson to go and you will dive into the most exciting section of this course. In next lesson, I will guide you how you can set up a wallet for Tezos Ghostnet Testnet network.
