# Prepare and Pin Tokens Metadata

Hey folks, welcome back! Great job on how far you have come in the course! So far you have learned about `tznft` CLI tool, prepared collection metadata and validated it as well.

Now, you will continue the last lesson by preparing the tokens metadata.

## Prepare tokens metadata

Let’s continue following the steps given below:

1. **Create tokens metadata:** First, we will create an NFT metadata JSON file using `create-nft-meta` command. Here’s the complete command structure:

```
tznft create-nft-meta <nft-name> <creator-name> <url>
```

The command takes the following parameters.

1. `<nft-name>`: The name you want to give to your token
2. `<creator-name>`: Name of the owner of the contract who wants to deploy the contract. Please use same name as you used in the testnet network.
3. `<url>`: Remember you copied CIDs from IPFS for your tokens in lesson “Upload Your Artwork to IPFS”? Now its time to use them. Make a URL like this: `ipfs://<CID>`

Here’s an example command I used to create tokens metadata.

```
tznft create-nft-meta Meowth_Pokemon_Card shaggy ipfs://QmTFSpf92bZ1YU91x7shRGE5AvhuoJmFCiCoKWHDerqqR4
```

Here’s a second command I used to create a metadata for my second token.

```
tznft create-nft-meta Squirtle_Pokemon_Card shaggy ipfs://QmfJxrztzTChkkixWiiEwPjq2GJePgcWcaiZ6ojPG9x3SS
```

Here’s the sample output, `Meowth_Pokemon_Card.json` file, of one of the above commands.

```
{
  "decimals": 0,
  "isBooleanAmount": true,
  "name": "Meowth",
  "description": "Meowth_Pokemon_Card",
  "tags": [
    "awesome",
    "nft"
  ],
  "minter": "tz1cZ2FgyPbjYD4ZEcARY51TswQaqjtzsJgr",
  "artifactUri": "ipfs://Qma8L2PoDBHMudRfJwkjpHEHoPkd5gnoY8w3qbksTCm3R6",
  "displayUri": "ipfs://Qma8L2PoDBHMudRfJwkjpHEHoPkd5gnoY8w3qbksTCm3R6",
  "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://Qma8L2PoDBHMudRfJwkjpHEHoPkd5gnoY8w3qbksTCm3R6",
  "creators": [],
  "rights": "",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name": "sample attribute",
      "value": "sample value"
    }
  ]
}
```

Please update the following properties in the JSON file.

1. description
2. tags
3. creators
4. rights
5. attributes

- **Note:** If you will not change any one of the property you will get a warning. Don’t worry you can ignore those warnings.

Here’s how my file looks like after making the changes in `Meowth_Pokemon_Card.json` file.

```
{
  "decimals": 0,
  "isBooleanAmount": true,
  "name": "Meowth_Pokemon_Card",
  "description": "Cat Pokemon",
  "tags": [
    "pokemon",
    "cat",
    "nft"
  ],
  "minter": "tz1UgMjLCCVqjHajGbbBBwapKFzS72ojmY44",
  "artifactUri": "ipfs://QmTFSpf92bZ1YU91x7shRGE5AvhuoJmFCiCoKWHDerqqR4",
  "displayUri": "ipfs://QmTFSpf92bZ1YU91x7shRGE5AvhuoJmFCiCoKWHDerqqR4",
  "thumbnailUri": "ipfs://QmTFSpf92bZ1YU91x7shRGE5AvhuoJmFCiCoKWHDerqqR4",
  "creators": ["Munim"],
  "rights": "None",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "name": "Rasengan",
      "value": "Fire Attack"
    },
    {
      "name": "Shurikin",
      "value": "Hot Air Attack"
    }
  ]
}
```

Do make sure to repeat the process for both of your Pokemon cards.

1. **Validate meta tokens:** Now, we will validate both of our tokens metadata JSON file using `validate-nft-meta` command. We need to validate metadata because metadata are generated randomly and after making the changes to file we need to make sure that we didn’t make in-valid changes. The command takes following parameters:

- `<metadata-file-name>`: Name of the token JSON file name created after running `create-nft-meta` command
- `--errors_only`: Optional flag to ignore any warnings

Here’s a complete command structure:

```
tznft validate-nft-meta <metadata-file-name>
```

Here’s an example command I used to validate tokens metadata.

```
tznft validate-nft-meta Meowth_Pokemon_Card.json
```

Here’s how the output looks like.

```
TZIP-021 metadata seems to be valid.
```

Repeat the command for both of your Pokemon cards tokens metadata files.

## Pin tokens metadata on IPFS

Before moving on to the minting part, you need to pin token metadata files to IPFS as well. Just like you pinned your tokens to IPFS. But this time, we will not use IPFS desktop app. We will use [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) Cloud because I want you (developers) to explore different tools to always have an alternative.

Follow the following steps to pin tokens metadata on Pinata IPFS.

1. **Set up Pinata account:** Head over to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create a free account.

   1. Click on “Start Building” button. It will take you to the sign up page.
   2. Enter your email address, select “Builder” in title section and move “Next.”
   3. Set your first name, last name and password.
   4. Confirm your email by entering the confirmation code.
   5. Your Pinata profile is ready to go. Here’s how it will look like:

2. Next, you need to upload JSON Pokemon card metadata files to Pinata dashboard.
   1. Click on “+ Add Files” button and select “File”.
   2. Click on “Select a file” button, browse through your folder and find the JSON token metadata file and select it.
   3. Repeat the same process for your second Pokemon card metadata file.

Here’s how I’m doing it:

You can copy the CID right next to the name of metadata file we just uploaded.

## That’s a wrap

So far, we have created the metadata for our Pokemon card tokens and pinned them on Pinata IPFS. In next lesson, we will finally mint the tokens and inspect them with the collection we make at the start of our journey.
