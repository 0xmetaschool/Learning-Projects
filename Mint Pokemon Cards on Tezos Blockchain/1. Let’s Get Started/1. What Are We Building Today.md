# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ðŸŒž, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Tezos for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be creating and minting our very first Pokemon card Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to the Tezos blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of minting your NFTs.

Letâ€™s look at how you will be interacting with the Pokemon card NFT by the end of the course.

Why Tezos? Tezos is an open-source PoS (Proof-of-stake) blockchain network that not only supports dApps but offers P2P (Peer to Peer) transactions via its native cryptocurrency, XTZ. Due to this, many high profile companies like [McLaren Racing](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/mclaren-racing-announces-new-multi-year-technical-partnership-with-tezos/), [OneOf](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/oneof-nft-marketplace-quincy-jones-whitney-houston-tlc-doja-cat-crypto-1173557/), [Ubisoft](https://newsroom.ubisoft-press.com/ubisoft-schliesst-sich-als-corporate-baker-dem-tezos-ecosystem-an), [Tada](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/blockchain-ride-hailing-app-tada-moves-to-greener-tezos-technology-838927572.html), [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-structured-product-public-blockchain) opt for Tezos as their blockchain of choice.

Not only this, Tezos network is seeing fast growth through global adoption. As of July 2023, Tezos has a total of 108,156,343 contract operations, 965,351,576 XTZ tokens, 2,428,880 funded accounts, and 179,327,746 transactions.
