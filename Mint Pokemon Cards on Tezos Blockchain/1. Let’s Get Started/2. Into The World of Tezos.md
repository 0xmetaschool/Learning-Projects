# Into The World of Tezos

So hey folks, you just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That something new is, you guessed it, the Tezos blockchain!

## So, what exactly is Tezos?

Tezos is an open-source blockchain network that supports both smart contracts and dApps. When Tezos launched its initial coin offering back in 2017, it successfully raised 232 million dollars.

Tezos uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to configure the transactions in the network. PoS allows Tezos to use less energy than Bitcoin mining, which make it more feasible to work with than other PoW blockchains.

Tezos has its own cryptocurrency called XTZ (also known as tez and tezzie), and the people who own XTZ get to vote on changes for the network. To summarise, the Tezos blockchain is:

- decentralized
- permissionless
- peer-to-peer transaction network facilitated by smart contracts

## What problems does Tezos solve?

Tezos solves big challenges faced by the blockchain ecosystem. Some of them are:

1. **Governance:** Bitcoin and Ethereum have governance limitations. They does not have formal governance system that can make them secure or scalable. While Tezos offers a great governance system that makes it more secure and scalable, which plays huge role in distinguishing Tezos from other blockchains.
2. **Consesus mechanism:** Tezos uses Proof-of-stake instead of Proof-of-work which makes it use less power and energy.

## Why mint NFTs on Tezos?

Tezos is becoming a popular choice for up-and-coming artists like me (I am also an artist ðŸ˜‰). Tezos has low gas fees, sleek marketplace, and great community.

People who love art have bought millions of amazing artworks from famous artists on Tezos-based marketplaces. Tezos is even the only blockchain that gets to be part of big art events like Art Basel and Venice Biennale. It's really making a splash in the art world!

Right now, [objkt.com](http://objkt.com/) is one of the most popular NFT marketplaces on Tezos. It's actually the one with the highest trading activity at the moment. [objkt.com](http://objkt.com/) works a lot like OpenSea, where anyone can make their own NFTs and sell them. It's a great platform for artists and collectors to connect!

So, youâ€™ve learned all about Tezos so far. Now, letâ€™s learn what token standard Tezos use to mint NFTs.

## Tezos token standard for NFTs

FA2 is a token standard on Tezos blockchain, also known as TZIP-12. It is an NFT contract that helps mint NFTs on Tezos blockchain. FA2 NFT contract is written in [LIGO](https://ligolang.org/?lang=jsligo) programming language and provides a standard API that can:

1. Transfer tokens
2. Check token balances
3. Manage operators (addresses that are permitted to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner)
4. Manage token metadata

In this course, we will use FA2 NFT contract and a command line interface (CLI) to create and interact with NFT contracts on Tezos testnet.

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Tezos has become one of the most popular blockchains for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thanks to its fast, cheap, and low gas transactions. Tezos allows the environment to be green by consuming less energy and power, which makes it environmental friendly and better than other blockchains.

In next lesson, you will learn to upload your artwork or any image to IPFS.
