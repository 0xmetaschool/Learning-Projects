# Data NFTs, Datatokens, and Compute-to-Data

Hey there, data friends! Welcome back to our Ocean Protocol fun time! Remember how we learned about the big picture last time? Well, this time we're going to look at some really cool stuff inside Ocean. We're going to talk about three super neat things that make Ocean Protocol special. We'll be covering Data NFTs, Datatokens, and the groundbreaking Compute-to-Data feature.
These things make Ocean Protocol really awesome for sharing and making money with data. Don't worry if it sounds tricky - we'll explain everything step by step. It's going to be fun, like finding treasure in a big ocean of information! Are you ready to dive in and learn more? Let's go!

## Data NFTs

Imagine you have a super-special trading card - it's shiny, one-of-a-kind, and has your name on it. That's kind of what Data NFTs are in Ocean Protocol! These digital treasures represent ownership of data. Just as each trading card is unique, each Data NFT stands for a special piece of data that someone owns or has the rights to use. 

Data NFTs are a cornerstone of ownership and licensing in Ocean Protocol. They represent unique digital assets, specifically the ownership or exclusive license of a data asset on the blockchain. Letâ€™s understand its key features:

**Key aspects of Data NFTs in Ocean Protocol:**

1. Creation Process:
    - When a user publishes a dataset on Ocean Protocol it automatically creates a new NFT.
    - This NFT serves as proof of the publisher's claim to the base intellectual property (IP) of the data asset.
2. Smart Contract Functionality:
    - The Data NFT smart contract is multifaceted, holding:
        - Metadata about the data asset
        - Role assignments (e.g., who can mint datatokens to use as access licenses)
        - Fee settings for accessing the data
        - An open-ended key-value store for custom fields
3. Technical Implementation:
    - Built on the ERC721 standard, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum and similar networks.
    - Utilizes the ERC721Factory contract, allowing base IP holders to create their own ERC721 contract instances.
    - Employs the ERC1167 proxy approach on the ERC721 template to optimize gas fees.
4. Ownership and Control:
    - The NFT holder has control over the associated data asset.
    - They can set access terms, pricing, and manage datatoken minting.
5. Interoperability:
    - Being based on a widely-adopted standard (ERC721), these NFTs can interact with various blockchain ecosystems and marketplaces.

Data NFTs form the foundation of Ocean Protocol's data ownership and licensing system, enabling a decentralized and transparent way to manage valuable data assets.

## Datatokens

Now, let's say you want to share your trading cards(Data NFTs) with your friends, but you want to decide who gets to come up and play. That's where Datatokens come in! They're like the secret passwords or special badges you give to your friends so they can access your trading card. In Ocean Protocol, Datatokens are the keys that unlock access to specific data NFT.

Technically, datatokens are the access control mechanism in Ocean Protocol, representing licenses to access specific data assets. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem's data economy.

**Key aspects of Datatokens:**

1. Nature and Purpose:
    - ERC20-compliant tokens representing access rights to specific data assets.
    - Each Data Token is linked to a particular Data NFT.
    - They act as sub-licenses from the base IP owner (Data NFT holder).
2. Value Derivation:
    - The value of Datatokens is based on:
        - Availability of the underlying dataset
        - Scarcity of access rights
        - Demand for the data
3. Functionality in the Ecosystem:
    - Enable easy trading, sharing, and accessing of data assets.
    - Allow users to consume associated datasets under predefined terms.
4. Technical Implementation:
    - Built on the ERC20 standard, ensuring wide compatibility with existing blockchain tools and platforms.
    - Multiple ERC20 Data Token contracts can be created for a single Data NFT.
    - Different Data Token contracts for the same NFT can represent varying license terms or access durations.
5. Flexibility and Customization:
    - Data owners can create multiple types of access rights for the same dataset.
    - This allows for tiered access, time-limited licenses, or other custom arrangements.
6. Economic Model:
    - Datatokens facilitate a liquid market for data access rights.
    - They can be traded on decentralized exchanges, creating a dynamic pricing mechanism for data.

Datatokens are the key to unlocking value in Ocean Protocol's data marketplace, allowing for granular control over data access while enabling a fluid economy around data assets.

## Compute-to-Data

Compute-to-Data (C2D) is an innovative feature in Ocean Protocol that addresses the challenge of utilizing valuable private data while maintaining strict privacy and control.

**Key aspects of Compute-to-Data:**

1. Core Concept:
    - Instead of moving data to where computation happens, C2D brings computation to the data.
    - Allows data owners to offer compute access to their private data without exposing the raw data.
2. Privacy Preservation:
    - Enables use of sensitive or proprietary data in computations without revealing the underlying data.
    - Maintains data owner's control over their asset throughout the process.
3. Process Flow:
    - Data remains in a secure environment controlled by the owner.
    - Approved algorithms or queries are sent to the data.
    - Computation occurs in a secure, isolated environment.
    - Only the computed results are returned, not the raw data.
4. Security Measures:
    - Secure transmission of algorithms to the data environment.
    - Execution in isolated environments to prevent data leakage.
    - Use of Confidential-EVM technology through Oasis Sapphire
    - Potential use of hardware-level security technologies like Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone for enhanced protection.
5. Use Cases:
    - Ideal for scenarios involving sensitive data, such as medical research, financial analysis, or proprietary business data.
    - Enables collaborative research and analysis without compromising data privacy.
6. Advantages:
    - Unlocks value from previously inaccessible data.
    - Encourages data sharing and collaboration in sensitive industries.
    - Reduces legal and compliance risks associated with data sharing.

Compute-to-Data represents a paradigm shift in how data can be utilized, offering a solution to the long-standing challenge of leveraging private data for broader benefits while maintaining strict control and privacy.

These three components work together to create a secure, flexible, and privacy-preserving data ecosystem:

- Data NFTs establish ownership and control over data assets
- Datatokens provide granular access control and enable monetization
- C2D allows for utilization of data while maintaining privacy and control

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we've explored three key components that form the backbone of Ocean Protocol's data ecosystem: Data NFTs, Datatokens, and Compute-to-Data. We've seen how Data NFTs establish ownership of data assets, Datatokens enable granular access control and monetization, and Compute-to-Data allows for data utilization while preserving privacy. These elements work in harmony to create a secure, flexible, and privacy-preserving marketplace for data.

Understanding these components is crucial for grasping the full potential of Ocean Protocol. In our next lesson, we'll build upon this knowledge as we deep dive into Ocean Protocol's architecture, exploring in detail the layers we introduced previously. We'll examine how these components fit into the broader architectural framework, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how Ocean Protocol operates from the ground up.
