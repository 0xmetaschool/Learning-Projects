# What Are We Learning Today?

Hey there fellas ðŸ‘‹, GM. We are very excited to bring the first-ever learning tutorial for developers in the Ocean Protocol on the Metaschool platform. Exciting right?

So, what exactly is the Ocean? Ocean Protocol is an open-source protocol designed to unlock the value of data for AI. Integrating blockchain technology and decentralized architecture establishes a secure and transparent sharing and exchange ecosystem for data and AI algorithms. This protocol empowers data and algorithms owners to retain control over their assets while enabling them to monetize their assets through various economic models.
