# The Origin of Ocean Protocol

Hey there, everyone!! We're thrilled you've decided to join us again and take your knowledge to the next level!

Before we dive into the Ocean Protocol, let's take a step back and understand why it was created. What's the big problem it aims to solve? And how does the Ocean Protocol come to the rescue? 

Before diving into the problem let’s revise the AI and blockchain, what problems they are solving separately, and how combining them can make changes. Let's find out together!

## The love for AI and Blockchain

Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy, the co-founders behind Ocean Protocol, are huge fans of AI. Why? Because AI makes life easier and tackles big challenges. Imagine this: AI can take a huge research paper and summarize it, or even help computer programs evolve and make a difference. Trent finds this super fascinating! As he puts it:

McConaghy's journey with blockchain began in 2013 when he and Bruce Pon co-founded Ascribe, a platform that used the Bitcoin blockchain to protect intellectual property (in the form of NFTs). This experience sparked his interest in the potential of blockchain to create a more secure and decentralized world.

Fast forward to 2016, Bruce and Trent wondered, "What if we could combine the magic of AI with the power of blockchain? How epic would that be?"

Picture this: Just like how blockchain can keep your cryptocurrency safe, it can also ensure that AI systems run smoothly and securely without a hitch. How exciting is that?

With stars in their eyes, they began exploring all the problems in the AI world that blockchain could fix. Let's dive into one of the major issues that blockchain can tackle.

## The problem

In the AI world, the biggest challenge is striking the right balance between leveraging data's potential and respecting user privacy.
Imagine this: Big companies like Google and Facebook have mountains of data and tons of AI know-how, but they can't just share it all with the world. Why? Because much of this data is personal and private—think medical records, financial information, or even just your daily habits. Sharing this data publicly would be both illegal and unethical.

Our world thrives on data, but the key is finding ways to share the *right kind* of data. This means focusing on data that's been anonymized or aggregated so that it doesn't reveal anyone's identity or sensitive information. Think about traffic patterns across a city or general trends in what people like to buy online. When this kind of non-personal data is shared responsibly, it can open up a world of possibilities for AI innovation.

Picture having access to anonymized data about how people use Google Maps. You could develop apps that predict traffic jams with incredible accuracy, helping everyone plan their routes more efficiently. Or imagine using aggregated data about online recipes to create a smart kitchen assistant that suggests personalized meal plans or even guides you through cooking a dish step-by-step.

The future of AI lies in finding creative and ethical ways to share data that benefit everyone while ensuring that individual privacy is always protected.

## The solution

The problem itself holds the key to the solution! The answer? A super cool platform that lets everyone access data easily and securely.

Enter the marketplace! Imagine a decentralized marketplace where anyone can offer and access datasets and algorithms - just like hugging face but fully self-sovereign and decentralized. It's like an online bazaar for data and models! One person can sell their assets, and anyone else can buy them safely and securely through this platform.

Picture this: Just like Etsy lets you buy handmade crafts from around the world, this data marketplace lets you buy and sell valuable data and algorithms. It’s a win-win for everyone, making data accessible and usable for all sorts of amazing projects!

## Initial development

In May 2017, the Ocean Protocol team unveiled a prototype marketplace for self-driving car data at the NYC Consensus. They even dabbled with zero-knowledge proofs to keep data super private.

But, like a homemade rocket that didn't quite reach the stars, this prototype didn't perform as well as hoped. It just wasn’t fast enough for the high-speed world of industrial development.

Imagine trying to race a go-kart in a Formula 1 race—it’s fun, but it just won’t keep up! Trent and his team learned a lot from this experiment, gearing up for even better solutions ahead.

## Launch and vision

In early 2017, a Singapore startup's CEO from Centralized Data Exchange saw the huge potential in decentralized tech and started working together with Trent and Bruce. 

Together they created an entire ecosystem of marketplaces, exchanges, and ways to supply, consume, and trade data. They created a network, a protocol, and a whole ecosystem to make this dream come true. That’s how the idea of the Ocean was born. Ocean would handle storing metadata, linking to data, and much more.

Imagine the Ocean as a vast digital sea where many marketplaces can float, all accessing the same treasure troves of data. It’s like having multiple ports where ships (marketplaces) can dock and trade valuable goods (data).

Trent McConaghy and his team believe Ocean will unlock their vision of a global data commons. The design of Ocean’s tokens reflects this ambitious goal, making data sharing as easy as trading Pokémon cards at recess!

## That’s a wrap

Ocean Protocol is a fantastic platform that tackles the big challenges in the world of AI. Imagine it as a giant, friendly octopus, spreading its tentacles to help everyone get the data they need.

The team is working hand-in-hand with DEX, other marketplaces, data regulators, data suppliers, and data consumers to turn this vision into reality.

In our next adventure, we'll dive deep into the Ocean Protocol, exploring its depths and discovering how it all works. Get ready to make a splash!
