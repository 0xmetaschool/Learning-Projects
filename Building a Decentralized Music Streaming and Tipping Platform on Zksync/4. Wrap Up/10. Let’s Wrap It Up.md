Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned and how it can empower you in the world of blockchain development.

### What We Covered

**Introduction:** Got an overview of what we will build and the course structure.

**Overview of ZKsync:** We learned about Native Account Abstraction and Paymaster and how they make ZKsync stand out among others.

**Music Streaming dApp:** We built a decentralized music streaming platform that puts artists and fans in control. 

- **Smart Contract Development:** We used Solidity to build smart contracts that handle music streaming, artist royalties, and secure tipping mechanisms.
