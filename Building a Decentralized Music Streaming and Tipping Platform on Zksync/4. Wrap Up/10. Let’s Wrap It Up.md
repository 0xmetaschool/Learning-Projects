### What We Covered

**Introduction:** Got an overview of what we will build and the course structure.

**Overview of ZKsync:** We learned about Native Account Abstraction and Paymaster and how they make ZKsync stand out among others.

**Music Streaming dApp:** We built a decentralized music streaming platform that puts artists and fans in control. 

- **Smart Contract Development:** We used Solidity to build smart contracts that handle music streaming, artist royalties, and secure tipping mechanisms.
