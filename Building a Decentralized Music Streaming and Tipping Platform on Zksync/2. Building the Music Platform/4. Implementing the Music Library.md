# Implementing the Music Library

Welcome back, everyone! Awesome job in coding `SongNFT` contract. In this lesson, we'll start building the contract for our music library or you can say the core contract which will be managing the overall functionalities of our streaming dApp. Let's dive in!

This contract will help us with the following:

1. Storing the music in the decentralized storage.
2. Maintaining the data structures to store and manage the music information.
3. Covering the functionalities of searching, browsing, and filtering music within the library.

## Let‚Äôs start implementing the contract

We will implement the music library code in the `deploy/zkTune.sol` file of the `boilerplate01` branch.

## Basics ‚úÖ

We want you to dive into the coding right away, so we have implemented the basics for you. 

- **Imports**: OpenZeppelin and other required contracts (yes, we need the `SongNFT.sol` we implemented in the previous lesson) are added.
- **Structs**: We require a few structs like Artist, User, and Song to store and retrieve certain details from this contract in a predefined way for the Artist struct we will have the name and the `profileURI` of the Artist as the members.

- **Mappings and Arrays**: The required mappings are also declared. We will need mappings to store and fetch the data for artists, songs, and users in key-value pairs.
- **Events:** Events are required to log certain activities on the chain.

- **Constructor**: Finally the constructor is also initialized.
- `onlyRegisteredArtist()`: A modifier to check if the `msg.sender`, this is, anyone interacting with this smart contract is a registered artist.
- `songExists`: A modifier to check if a song exists or not.

## Time to code! üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

Well, we have covered all the basics, now it‚Äôs time to explore the functionalities of this contract.

We have a few assignments for you here and there, so make sure to complete them too. Well, let‚Äôs not wait and dive right into it.

### Register Artist function

This function registers a new artist on the blockchain. It first checks if the sender (artist) is already registered or not, increments a counter for the artist ID, stores artist details in mappings, add the artist address to an array, and emits an event to notify of the registration.

Now it's time to test your knowledge, we have three assignments here for you. You need to implement the missing code at line `99`, `107`, and `110` in the `zkTune.sol` file.

![zksync (17).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(17).jpg?raw=true)

### Register User Function

Since we are taking registrations for artists, we should also have some functions for user registration as well right? This function registers a new user by storing user data on the blockchain. Again it starts with checking if the user is already registered or not, stores user details in a mapping, and emits a UserRegistered event.

Complete the assignment at line `124`. The hint is already there in the code!

![zksync (18).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(18).jpg?raw=true)

### Add Song Function

Next, let's add a function to handle the addition of new songs. So first it starts with incrementing a song ID counter, deploys a new SongNFT contract, stores song details in a mapping, adds the song ID to arrays for general and artist-specific song lists, and increments the total song count.

It's test time! Complete the assignments on lines `139` and `146`.

![zksync (19).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(19).jpg?raw=true)

### Stream Song Function

This function allows users to stream a song. If the user already owns the NFT for the song, the audio URI is returned directly. Otherwise, a new NFT is minted for the user, the stream count is incremented, and the song is added to the user's stream history. The audio URI is then returned.

Now complete the assignments on lines `157`, `164`, and `171`.

![zksync (21).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(21).jpg?raw=true)

### Get All Songs Function

This function is a getter function that retrieves all songs uploaded on the platform. It creates an array of Song structs and populates it all the songs fetched using allSongs mapping where songID is the key. Now the trick is to run a for-loop till the number of total songs uploaded on the platform. 

With that said, let's move on to the assignment part, complete the assignment on line `179`.

![zksync (22).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(22).jpg?raw=true)

### Get All Artists Function

This function retrieves all registered artists. It creates an array of Artist structs and populates it with artists from the `artistAddresses` array. Well if you were not able to solve the assignment around getAllSongs(), observe the implementation of this function clearly üòâ

![zksync (23).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(23).jpg?raw=true)

### Get Songs By Artist Function

This function retrieves all songs by a specific artist. It gets the artist's song IDs, creates an array of Song structs, and populates it with the corresponding songs from the `songs` mapping.

Complete the assignment on line `201`. It might look a bit hard but trust us you can do it and we are there for you!

![zksync (24).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(24).jpg?raw=true)

### Get Songs Streamed By User Function

This function retrieves all songs streamed by a specific user. It gets the user's streamed song IDs, creates an array of Song structs, and populates it with the corresponding songs from the `songs` mapping.

Complete the assignment on line `211`. Again both `getSongsByArtist` and `getSongsStreamedByUser` follow similar implementation.

![zksync (25).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%204%20Implementing%20the%20Music%20Library/zksync_(25).jpg?raw=true)

## Run your code

You can run your code using the `npx hardhat compile` command. Running the command will help you find and resolve the errors early on.

You can find the complete code [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/contracts/zkTune.sol). 

## Push your code

Implement the complete code of the `zkTune.sol` contract and push it to the `boilerplate01` branch. You can follow the following commands.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Done with the implementation of zkTune.sol"
git push -u origin boilerplate01
```

## That‚Äôs a wrap

ZkTune is a cool music streaming and NFT minting platform. It uses ERC721 tokens to show ownership of unique music tracks. Artists can sign up, add their songs, and make money by minting NFTs. You can also create playlists and enjoy a royalty system for NFT resales. In the next lesson, we will explore the Paymaster contract.
