# Implementing the ERC20 Song Token

Let's kick things up and start building the contracts for our music streaming dApp! We will dive into three super important contracts to make our music dApp work smoothly.

1. **SongNFT Contract**: This is where the magic happens! We'll store all the juicy song details and mint our unique Song NFTs here. Imagine your favorite song as a one-of-a-kind collectible!
2. **zkTune Contract**: Think of this as our playlist manager. It will help us create and manage playlists, track all the songs, add new ones, stream our jams, and keep tabs on our talented artists. It's like having Spotify, but way cooler and decentralized!
3. **Paymaster Contract**: This contract is our financial wizard. It handles account abstraction using zkSync contracts, making sure everything runs smoothly without a hitch.

Here’s what the system design diagram looks like:

## Set up the project
To simplify it, we have already prepared a simplified version of the template so you can focus on the right set of contracts we need to build our dApp. Let’s run the following commands to set up your project:

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform.git --clone
```

## Set up branch

We will first make sure that we are at the right branch. Go to the root folder first, the run the following command to be at the `boilerplate01` branch. At `boilerplate01`, we have made a basic HardHat project for you with the empty files. You’ll have to implement the code in those files.

```
cd zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform
git checkout boilerplate01
```

Also, if you are using VSCode, you can find the branch name in the left-down corner. And by clicking on it, you can switch the branches.

![vscode.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/vscode.webp?raw=true)

Now run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies. Make sure you are in the root folder.

```
npm install
```

## Let’s start implementing the contract

Before we begin, let's keep one important thing in mind: you cannot use Solidity or Vyper code directly on the ZKsync ERA VM. However, we will still write the entire code in Solidity and use zksolc to compile it for the ZKsync ERA VM (Don’t worry we will show you how to use it later in the course). You can read more about this process [here](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/specification#glossary).

You might also be wondering about the differences between the ZKsync ERA VM and the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) because solidity is compatible with EVM right? While we won't be diving deep into these differences to maintain our focus on coding, we highly recommend checking out [this page](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions). It will walk you through the key distinctions that make the ZKsync ERA VM stand out!

Okay Let’s get back to coding and start implementing the Song NFT. We will implement the NFT code in the `deploy/SongNFT.sol` file of the `boilerplate01` branch.

![songNFT.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT.webp?raw=true)

**Note:** Instead of handpicking you, we will guide you on what code you have to implement and then you’ll have to implement the code yourself.

### Implement the basics

First, we will implement the basics and import the dependencies. We have already done this for you. You can check the boilerplate.

![songToken - 2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songToken_-_2.webp?raw=true)

### Contract declaration

After importing the dependencies, we all know that we need to create the contract itself and use those imports in the contract. So, let’s inherit the `ERC721URIStorage` and `Ownable` contracts where `ERC721URIStorage` is used for token management and `Ownable` is used for access control.

```
contract SongNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
	// Contract code goes here
}
```

We will now start with adding the code to the `SongNFT` contract. But before we ask you to code anything, let us clear the basic structure of our `SongNFT` contract to you. 

### Using SafeMath library

First, we will import `SafeMath` inside the contract for safe arithmetic operations. This library helps check for overflow and underflow of arithmetic operations in Solidity. But if you are using Solidity 0.8.0 or above you can skip it as Solidity now natively supports these checks, we are using it in our project to show you the usage of the `SafeMath` library.

![songToken - safeMath.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songToken_-_safeMath.webp?raw=true)

### State variables

After importing the contracts we will start the implementation. We will define the state variables of the contract. We have already defined these for you in the `boilerplate01` code.

![songToken - vars.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songToken_-_vars.webp?raw=true)

### Struct definition

After the state variables, we will define the struct `NFTInfo` to store comprehensive information about the NFT. The `NFTInfo` struct will help us return the NFT information to the user. 

![songNFT- struct.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_struct.webp?raw=true)

### Constant declaration

Next, we need a constant that can help us calculate the royalties of the NFTs. For this, we will declare a constant representing the royalty percentage (30%) on NFT minting.

![songNFT- constant.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_constant.webp?raw=true)

### Events

And before we move forward to defining the functions of the contract, we will define the events. Events will basically help us to log the successful execution of a function for the way an event is implemented in the contract. Here, we are creating three events that gets triggered at different points in the contract.

![songNFT- events.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_events.webp?raw=true)

### Modifier

So far we have implemented all the basics of the contract. Now, we will implement the `onlyMintedUser` modifier which will restrict the function access to users who own at least one NFT. It will take the user's address and check the balance if it is bigger than `0`.

Here is your first assignment. You need to implement the missing code at line `51` in the `SongNFT.sol` file.

![songNFT- modifier.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_modifier.webp?raw=true)

**Hint:** Try using the `balanceOf()` and `user` statements.

### Constructor

Next, we need to implement the most crucial part of the contract: the constructor. The constructor will initialize the state variables using the input parameters. We will also call the ERC721 constructor here and pass the required parameters.

Your second task is to initialize the state variables with the appropriate input parameters. Please implement your solution in the `SongNFT.sol` file at lines `60`-`63`.

![songNFT- constructor.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_constructor.webp?raw=true)

### Mint NFT function

After implementing the function, let's move on to the core of this contract, that is, minting NFTs. The `mintNFT` function will mint the new NFT. It will also calculate the royalty amount for the NFT and ensure the royalty collection event is emitted. 

Here, we have five assignments for you. Please fill in the missing code on lines `71`, `74`, `90`, `92`, and `95` with the appropriate code.

![songNFT- mintNFT.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_mintNFT.webp?raw=true)

**Don’t worry, try googling a bit maybe? if you get stuck,** we will provide the full code solution to you.

### Pay royalties function

`payRoyalties` function pays out the accumulated royalties to the artist. We have missed some code here as well for you to implement.

So, fill in the missing code and implement it with the appropriate information.

![songNFT- payRoyalties (1).png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_payRoyalties_(1).webp?raw=true)

### Get info function

Lastly, we have the `getInfo` function. The `getInfo` function retrieves comprehensive information about the NFT for a user who owns at least one NFT where `onlyMintedUser(user)` ensures the user owns an NFT.

Here, we have one last assignment for you where you have to initialize the `NFTInfo` fields using the state variables.

![songNFT- getInfo.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%203%20Implementing%20the%20ERC20%20Song%20Token/songNFT-_getInfo.webp?raw=true)

## Push your code

Implement the complete code of the `SongNFT` contract and push it to the `boilerplate01` branch. You can follow the following commands.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Done with the implementation of SongNFT.sol"
git push -u origin boilerplate01
```

## Check your solution

Now that you have implemented all of the assignments, let’s check your solution and see if it is as expected.

Head over [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/complete-codes/contracts/SongNFT.sol) to see the full solution.

## That’s a wrap

Great work folks!! We’re so proud of you! The ERC20 token that helps us mint the song NFT is completed now. Next, we’ll implement the music library that will help us keep track of all the information we need to build our dApp.

Assignment: Implement the `getInfo` function and share the screenshot of the code.
