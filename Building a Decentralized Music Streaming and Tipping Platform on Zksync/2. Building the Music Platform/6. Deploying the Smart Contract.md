# Deploying the Smart Contract

It's time to deploy our smart contract to the ZKsync Sepolia Testnet, we hope you are pumped! Alongside this, we'll set up the frontend boilerplate, allowing you to interact seamlessly with your deployed contract. 

## Modify env variables

To deploy our contract, we'll need access to our wallet’s private key. If you're not familiar with how to fetch the private key, follow the instructions below:

- Click the round icon in the top right corner of MetaMask to choose the account you want to export the private key from. Access the account details by clicking the "three dots" button and selecting "Account details."
- In the Account Details screen, click the "Export Private Key" button.
- Unlock your wallet by entering your MetaMask password.
- The private key will be displayed in hex format.

- Copy the private key and paste it into the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` variable in your `.env` file. To do this, open the `.env` file in your project’s root directory. If the file doesn’t exist, create it. Add a line with the `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` variable and set its value to the copied private key, like this:

  ```
  WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="Your_PRIVATE_KEY_goes_here"
  ```

Here’s what the `.env` file looks like:

Make sure to save the file after making this change and with that done and dusted, we are all set to compile our smart contract.

**Note:** If you create your hardhat project zksync-cli as we discussed earlier, the private key would be asked directly as a prompt and a `.env` will be automatically created with the private key as the environmental variable

## Compiling the smart contract

With the environment variable set, we are now ready to compile our smart contract. Open your terminal and navigate to your project’s root directory. Run the following commands:

```
npm install 
npx hardhat compile   
```

Here we are using `zksolc` as the compiler which is a LLVM compiler which compiles Solidity or Vyper code to ZKsync ERA VM, read more about it [here](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain) and is a part of ZKsync hardhat template. The configuration for `zksolc` is included in `hardhat.config.ts`

Now once the compilation is successful, we can proceed to deploy our smart contract on the ZKsync Sepolia Testnet. After setting up the boilerplate, you'll find a file named `deploy.ts` in the `deploy` folder. This file contains the necessary code for deployment:

```
import { deployContract } from "./utils";

export default async function () {
  const Paymaster = "GeneralPaymaster";
  const PaymasterArguments = [];
  await deployContract(Paymaster, PaymasterArguments);

  const contractArtifactName = "zkTune";
  const dAppArguments = [];
  await deployContract(contractArtifactName, dAppArguments);
}
```

Remember the `deployContract` function from `utils.ts`? Yes, now we will be using that to deploy our contract to the ZKsync blockchain and also verify it. We will simply pass the contract's artifact name and its arguments (in an array) to this function.

```
deployContract(Artifact-Name, Arguments);
```

Finally, Run the following command in your terminal to deploy your smart contract: 

```
npm run deploy
```

Here’s how we’re deploying the contracts.

## Funding the Paymaster contract

Next thing to do before we move on to setting up from the front end is to fund our Paymaster contract. This can be quite easily done by :

- Copy the Paymaster contract address.
- Open MetaMask.
- Click on "Send" in MetaMask, paste the Paymaster contract address into the recipient field, and enter 0.04 ETH as the amount.
- Review the details and confirm the transaction. Wait for the transaction to be processed.

## Quick code checkout

Let's quickly bring in the front-end code for interacting with our Smart Contract. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```
git checkout boilerplate02
```

**No need to worry** - this update only touches the frontend components, so all your existing code is safe!

## Moving the ABIs to the frontend

After deploying the contracts and funding the paymaster contract, you’ll see two new folders are created, named: `artifacts-zk` and `cache-zk`. Our contract ABIs exist in the `artifacts-zk/contracts` folder.

So, copy the following files and paste them in the `interface/src/ABI` folder.

1. `/artifacts-zk/contracts/paymasters/GeneralPaymaster.sol/GeneralPaymaster.json`
2. `/artifacts-zk/contracts/SongNFT.sol/SongNFT.json` 
3. `/artifacts-zk/contracts/zkTune.sol/zkTune.json`

Here’s the image of the ABI files for your ease.

## Configuring the frontend

To enable our React frontend app to interact with the smart contracts, we need to provide it with their addresses. Open the `.env` file located in the `interface` folder and paste the addresses for both the `zkTune` and `General Paymaster` contracts.

## Quick Check Point

Update your code to the forked GitHub Repository using the following commands: 

```
git add .
git commit -m "config update"
git push
```

## That’s a Wrap

Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed your smart contract to the ZKsync Sepolia Testnet and funded the Paymaster contract. In the next lesson, we’ll fully set up our front end to interact with the app. See you then!
