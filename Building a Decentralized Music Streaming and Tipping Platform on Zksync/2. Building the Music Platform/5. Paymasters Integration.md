# Paymasters Integration

Lastly, you implemented the song NFT and music library for your music streaming dApp. Now, we need to integrate the Paymaster functionality into our dApp. We know you have been coding for a while, so let’s take a step back, relax and understand this concept.

## Paymaster

Navigate to the `paymasters/GeneralPaymaster` for the Paymaster code. ZKsync provides a built-in project folder when you run `zksync-cli create` that has the `GeneralPaymaster.sol` file. So, you don’t have to worry about implementing it. But, we surely need to understand how it works so that we can use it in our front end with ease.

### Paymaster contract overview

Again as we discussed earlier, Paymasters are specialized accounts that subsidize users’ transaction fees on blockchain networks, allowing for more flexibility and user-friendly interactions. They also enable users to pay fees with various tokens instead of just ETH. 

Let’s understand it technically. So, the Paymaster has the following two functions:

- `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction`: This functions uses the transaction parameters to check for the required validations, validate it, and then pay for the transaction fee.
- `postTransaction`: This optional function runs after the transaction is executed.

Now you have a basic idea of the system design of the Paymaster contract, but when we say 'basic,' there's more to it. There are two different types of Paymaster flow. When we say 'flow,' we mean the way the `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` function is executed based on the parameters. Let’s dig deeper into it.

### Flows of Paymaster

The two flows of Paymaster are as follows:

- General Paymaster Flow: This is the default flow where a user requires no preceding actions before the paymaster contract can validate and pay for the transaction.
- Approval-Based Paymaster Flow: In this flow, we need user permission such as token allowance before the paymaster contract can read the transaction data and cover the transaction fees.

But wait, before we start digging deeper, it's important to note that both of these flow codes(General Paymaster and Approval-Based Paymaster) are part of the Hardhat Solidity template provided by ZKsync. The purpose of this section is to help you understand how these two flows work technically.

### So, how to use the paymaster contract?

Let us give you a quick rundown of how we used our Paymaster contract on the front end as an example. In this case, let’s start by understanding how the general Paymaster flow works first. We will use the example of the `streamSong()` function, which we will be calling in our frontend. Whenever a user clicks on any song to play, this frontend function calls `streamSong()` from the contract with the song's ID as an argument.

Generally, if you want to call the `streamSong()` function, you would have called it like this right? 

![zksync-paymaster-1.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/zksync-paymaster-1.png?raw=true)

Where a contract is the instance of your `zkTune` contract. In this case, whenever they click on any song to stream, the user will pay the fees. But let me show you how you can call it using a Paymaster contract. First, you need to get the current gas price.

![zksync-paymaster-2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/zksync-paymaster-2.png?raw=true)

After setting the gas price, we’ll estimate the gas limit, gas limit as you know is the max amount of gas required for this transaction. In this case, `paymasterParams` contains the address of the `GeneralPaymaster` contract and `contract` represents the interface of your zkTune contract.

To calculate gas limit, we will use `estimateGas()` which returns the amount of gas required to submit the transaction from `contract.streamSong` object on ZKsync. Normally we would have just submitted `from`, `value` as part of the standard Ethereum transaction data right? But since we are using Paymaster contract we also need to include `customData` which will contain the parameters required for Paymaster.

![zksync-paymaster-3.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/zksync-paymaster-3.png?raw=true)

After calculating the gas limit, we need to prepare the transaction with all the required parameters, now this is the final stage as we will group all the data to be included in the transaction.

![zksync-paymaster-4.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/zksync-paymaster-4.png?raw=true)

Then finally you can call the `streamSong()` function with the song id as the parameter as you usually would have along with the `txOverrides` you created where paymaster will pay the already calculated gas fees on the caller’s behalf.

### Approval-Based Paymaster Flow

Now suppose you want to implement the same `streamSong()` function using an approval-based flow where the user will need to pay a custom ERC20 set by us in order to stream the song. In this scenario, there will be two more actors for the `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` to validate and pay for the gas fees on the user’s behalf.

1. `allowedToken`: This variable accepts the address of the custom ERC20 token in which the user will pay the gas fees. Let’s call it SONG for example.
2. `PRICE_FOR_PAYING_FEES`: This is a constant variable that sets the price for the gas fees, that is, the amount of the SONG token, the user needs to pay for the Paymaster contract to cover the gas fees. Let’s say we set it to 1 which means a user when transacting on your game needs to pay 1 SONG token for the paymaster to cover the gas fees on the user’s behalf

But how to implement this now?

While implementing the general paymaster flow the only paymaster parameter we were passing was the address of the paymaster contract. But in the case of Approval-based flow, we need to restructure the Paymaster parameters to include other details as well, so let’s see how we can restructure our Paymaster parameters with the new flow in place:

![paymaster-params.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/paymaster-params.png?raw=true)

Here we pass a few important details as parameters.

1. Your Paymaster address which is the contract address of the approval-based paymaster contract deployed on ZKsync.
2. The address of the ERC20 token we want our users to use when streaming songs, in this case, we need to pass the contract address of the SONG token.
3. Next, we need to pass the type of flow we are using, in our case, we are trying to implement “ApprovalBased”.
4. Then, we need to pass the amount of token to be approved for sending the transaction which should be equal to `PRICE_FOR_PAYING_FEES` set in the contract.
5. Lastly, innerInput represents any payload we need to send to the paymaster contract in bytes.

And that’s it, now you follow the same steps as the general flow and pass these parameters while creating the transaction like this:

Okay, that’s all about Paymaster but before we move on to the next lesson, have you noticed a file called`utils.ts`? Well, this is a part of the hardhat template by ZKsync and it makes your deployment process so much easier. Let us give you a quick walkthrough before we move on to deploy the contracts in the next lesson.

## Utils.ts file

In summary `utils.ts` provides you with all the necessary functions to deploy and verify a contract on the ZKsync blockchain.

![zksync-paymaster-6.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Zksync-assests/Lesson%205%20Paymasters%20Integration/zksync-paymaster-6.png?raw=true)

You might be wondering about this screenshot of a block of code but don’t worry this is the `deployContract()` from `utils.ts` which we will be using in our deploy script.

So it basically deploys the contract and then verifies it, we will not go deep into the theoretical part of how this function works because this file was meant to make your life easier haha, so in the next lesson we will show you how we can use this function to deploy our contracts.

## That’s a wrap

Great work, rockstars!! You’ve completed the implementations of all of the contracts and understood the integrations. In the next lesson, we will implement the deploy script and finally deploy the contracts.
