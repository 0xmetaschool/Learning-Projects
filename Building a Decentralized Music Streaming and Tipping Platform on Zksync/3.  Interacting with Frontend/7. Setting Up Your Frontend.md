# Setting Up Your Frontend

Congratulations, you have been doing great this far, you have deployed your own music streaming contracts to the ZKsync network 🎊 and set up the contract addresses in the environment file of your frontend. In this lesson, we will set up the Pinata which we will need for our frontend to work.

## Getting started with Pinata IPFS

First of all, we will set up the Pinata so that we can store our song NFTs in the IPFS.

So what is a Pinata? Its a peer-to-peer database storage system. Here, we save our data and access it using a URL. Unlike centralized storage, data in this system is distributed across multiple computers called peers. Okay so, here’s what we’re gonna do.

1. Sign up for Pinata
2. Create new API keys
3. Fetch the keys
4. Add the keys to the `.env` file

So, we have given you an overview here. Let’s move on to actually doing it.

### Signup to Pinata

Head over to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create a free account.

1. Click on the “Start Building” button. It will take you to the sign-up page.
2. Enter your email address, select “Builder” in the title section, and move “Next.”
3. Set your first name, last name, and password.
4. Confirm your email by entering the confirmation code.
5. Your Pinata profile is ready to go. Here’s what it will look like:

### Create new API keys

Next, we need to create new API keys so that we can use them to connect to Pinata in the front end.

1. Go to the “API Keys” section on the sidebar.

2. Click on the “+ New Key” button on the top right.

3. On the “Create API Key” page, enter your project name as the key name and give the Admin rights. Finally, click the “Generate API Key” button to generate the keys.

4. Lastly, copy the “API Key” and “API Secret” and paste them in the `.env` file in your interface folder.

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY="PINATA_API_KEY_goes_here"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY="PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY_goes_here"
    ```

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, you set up the Pinata with your front end. In the next lesson, we will give you a bird-eye view of how the frontend works and understand some of its important aspect
