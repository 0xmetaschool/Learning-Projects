# Understanding the Frontend

Hey fellow devs, lastly we worked on setting up the environment for the ZKsync now let’s understand the important components of the our frontend. We don’t want to explain the code line by line

## Connecting the wallet

First we need to understand how we are handling the wallet connection for our dApp. But before we start, the frontend is created using the `react_next_wagmi` template using `zksync-cli` as we learned in the previous lesson. 

So, the first part of connecting the wallet is understanding how `Context.tsx` works, which was a part of the template, it exports the following functions

- account - which stores the address of the wallet connected to the dApp and if the wallet is connected or not
- network - this field will store the network information
- switchNetwork - this is responsible for switching the network to a certain `chainId`
- connect() - this function will be used to initiate the wallet connection and update the component state accordingly
- disconnect() - this function will be used to disconnect the user wallet which basically means resetting the states of the component to its initial state
- getProvider() - this function will return the provider object
- getSigner() - this function will return the signer object

These exports are crucial, they manage the end to end wallet connection states which makes it easy for us to reuse this component wherever we need to use the wallet without having to create the these functions again and again, which is a bad code practice. You can review the whole code for `Context.tsx` [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/interface/src/components/Context.tsx).

## Playing song

This is one of the most important component in our dApp and it helps with the core functionality, that is, playing songs and this is implemented in [`usePlaySong.tsx`](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/interface/src/components/usePlaySong.tsx) which exports 3 functions `playSong`, `currentSong`, `message` . The flow of this component works like this,

USER → Clicks on a song → play song function is called with the details of the songs → first it checks if the user has minted the song NFT? → if yes the song data is fetched from the contract and played → if no the song NFT is minted to user wallet thanks to Paymaster, the user doesn’t have to pay any fees making it seamless and then played

Feel free to go through the code [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/interface/src/components/usePlaySong.tsx), before we move on to the next component

## Handling IPFS

Wait we want to play these songs but you might be wondering where these songs are stored when we haven’t implemented any web2 storage solutions like mongoDB or SQL server

Well that’s where IPFS comes into play. IPFS is a p2p storage solution used in web3 development to store files in a decentralized manner making it secure and tamper proof like blockchain.

In our dApp we have introduced a component called [`uploadIPFS.tsx`](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/interface/src/components/uploadIPFS.tsx) which again exports 3 functions,

1. uploadToIPFS: This function enables other components to pass a file and upload it to IPFS using API call(we are using Pinata here which is one of the providers of IPFS)
2. isUploading: This is a boolean which returns the loading state of the component, that is, if the uploadIPFS component is pending or completed
3. error: This returns any error that arise during the uploading process of the component, that we can use as a log to debug the code if any problem arises

Now the working of this component is pretty simple as this leverages the Pinata API to upload the files to IPFS and return its CID which is basically a hash used for unique identification of each files on IPFS.

We recommend you to check out the code for this component [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/zksync-music-streaming-and-tipping-platform/blob/boilerplate02/interface/src/components/uploadIPFS.tsx).

## Wrap up

In this we learned about some of the important components of our dApp, we wish we could explain the code line by line for you but we know you are smart enough to figure out the rest and you can always reach us out if you are stuck somewhere or even if you wanna say “Hi”!
