# What Are We Building Today?

Hey there rockstars ðŸ‘‹, gm. We are very excited to bring the first-ever learning tutorial for developers on ZKsync on the Metaschool platform. Exciting right?

First, let's dive into some impressive numbers. ZKsync is already a powerhouse with [1.5M followers on X](https://x.com/zksync) and [760k+ Discord members](https://discord.com/invite/8h9rrE3). With over 400M transactions and 7M addresses, it's clear that ZKsync is booming. Awesome, isnâ€™t it?

So, what makes ZKsync so special? It's a powerful layer 2 solution that makes Ethereum faster, more affordable, and easier to use. It is a verifiable blockchain network that ensures the integrity and authenticity of its data through cryptographic proofs.

ZKsync leverages a technology called Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. It bundles hundreds of transactions and verifies them off-chain using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It submits the validity proof (Donâ€™t worry, we will dig deep on this topic in the upcoming lessons) on Ethereum. All this makes users feel like they are using Ethereum but with low fees and a much higher throughput. But wait you might be thinking, whatâ€™s so different about ZKsync? We will learn about this in the upcoming lessons as we dig deep into its architecture.

Hold your horses before you hit that next button! Let's quickly take a peek at what's in store and what goodies you'll take away from this course.

## Building a Decentralized Music Streaming Platform

In this course, we're building a decentralized music streaming platform that puts artists and fans in control. We'll dive deep into ZKsync's unique features to create a seamless Web3 experience.

Here's what you'll learn:

- **Native Account Abstraction (NAA):** Discover how NAA simplifies user onboarding by eliminating the need for private key management and gas fees.
- **Paymaster Integration:** Explore how Paymasters enable gasless transactions, making it easy for fans to tip their favorite artists.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Master Solidity by building smart contracts that handle music streaming, artist royalties, and secure tipping mechanisms.
- **ZKsync Deployment:** Deploy your decentralized music platform on the ZKsync testnet and experience the future of music firsthand.

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Master ZKsync's Native Account Abstraction and Paymaster to create a seamless user experience

2. Set up your development environment with MetaMask, ZKsync CLI, and HardHat.

4. Implement a secure payment and tipping system with smart contracts.

5. Deploy your decentralized music platform to the ZKsync testnet and interact with the frontend.

## **Who exactly should take this course?**

This ZKsync course is for blockchain enthusiasts who are excited to know how ZKsync brings ZK-proof empowerment and for the peeps who want to contribute to the ZKsync ecosystem.

If you are new to the blockchain you might take time to learn, hey we are here to uplift you but for intermediate and advanced-level developers, understanding this new technology will be thrilling.

## Pre-requisites

There are a few tools that you need to install to proceed with the course. Make sure you have the following:

1. Install [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/).
2. Connect Metamask by clicking on the "Add ZKsync Sepolia Testnet" button on the official [ZKsync website](https://docs.zksync.io/build/connect-to-zksync).
3. **ZKsync Sepolia Testnet Faucets:** Here's how you can fuel your development adventures by getting some testnet ETH :
    1. [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/zksync/sepolia): This faucet provides Sepolia ETH, requires a QuickNode account, and wants you to have 0.1 ETH in the ZKsync mainnet.
    2. [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/zksync-sepolia): A multi-chain faucet that also dispenses Sepolia ETH without you having any mainnet tokens.
4. Download & Install:
    1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    2. [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## What will you be getting out of this course?

You will be getting the following outcomes when you complete this course:

1. Understanding the core concepts of native account abstraction and paymaster in ZKsync
2. Setting up the environment to start working on your next moonshot idea on ZKsync
3. Implementing the logic for decentralized music streaming application using Solidity
4. Deploying and integrating the contracts using the frontend boilerplate provided by us 
5. Claim your NFT on course completion

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course, you will get a special NFT, a utility token, unlocking many more opportunities on the Metaschool platform. Here is what the NFT looks like.
