# Introduction to Native Account Abstraction and Paymaster

Welcome devs!! You are awesome as you've chosen to step up, dive into this exciting world, and become builders in this cutting-edge space. To start with the course, we first need to equip ourselves with some important concepts to know the essentials and building becomes easier for us. This lesson will dive deep into the native account abstraction and Paymasters.

## Overview of account abstraction

Ethereum has two types of accounts:

1. Externally owned accounts (EOAs)
2. Smart contract accounts

To understand these imagine you have two types of bank accounts:

1. **Regular Accounts (EOAs):** These are the only types of accounts that can initiate any transaction. But the constraint is that you can't add any special rules or automated actions to it. 
2. **Smart Contract Accounts:** Now these accounts can have complex rules, like automatically paying bills or saving a portion of each deposit. However, it can't send money (or initiate a transaction) on its own; a trigger is needed for these actions. Meaning the contract accounts can’t initiate the transactions.

### UX Problems with EOA accounts

1. Users usually find it difficult to keep their private keys safe. In case they lose it, they also lose the funds and account. 
2. There’s no recovery for the private key. If anyone else has it, they own the account.
3. The transaction verification process for EOAs is standardized and implemented consistently across different EVM implementations. This limits the flexibility of transaction authorization compared to smart contract accounts. This means there is no flexibility like a smart contract accounts

Now, imagine another type of account that combines the best of both accounts and doesn’t have such problems. Well, let me introduce you to Account Abstraction.

These accounts can send money like a “Regular EOA Accounts” and have complex rules like a regular “Smart Contract Account”. 

These accounts are implemented with “**Natively**” on ZKsync where all the accounts on ZKsync are treated as smart contracts enabling smart contract features like programmable logic, custom transaction validation, and gas abstraction.

## So, what exactly is native account abstraction (NAA)?

So we know about Account Abstraction and know that Ethereum offers it in the form of [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). We know that, unlike traditional blockchains where users interact directly with the network using Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) like MetaMask, ZKsync introduces a protocol-level approach where you can implement account abstraction without the need for any external infrastructure making it “native”. This changes how accounts operate. It does so by having the following concepts:

- **Account Abstraction:** Every account on ZKsync is essentially a smart contract. This means they can have custom logic, allowing for features like multi-signature wallets, social recovery, spending limits, and more.
- **Paymasters:** These are smart contracts that can facilitate gasless transactions and allow users to pay gas fees in any ERC20 tokens. This opens up possibilities for gasless transactions, bulk transactions, and other innovative use cases.

## Technical Implications

Let’s learn about the implementation and enhancements ZKsync has brought to us:

- **Unified Mempool:** ZKsync handles all transactions, regardless of whether they're from a standard account or a smart account, in a single Mempool. This simplifies the transaction processing by eliminating the two separate transaction flows where transactions are first stored in separate mempool and then consolidated using a bundler.
- **Protocol Level Integration:** Account abstraction is a core part of the ZKsync protocol, ensuring optimal performance and security compared to solutions that implement account abstraction as an add-on.

In essence, ZKsync's native account abstraction provides a more flexible, secure, and developer-friendly environment compared to traditional account models. It's a foundational component of the ZKsync ecosystem that enables a wide range of innovative applications.

## Let’s discuss the benefits of a native account abstraction

You’ve got the hang of account abstraction, so now let’s dive into all the awesome perks it brings!

- **Enhanced User Experience:** By providing more flexibility and customization, ZKsync can offer a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional accounts.
- **Security Improvements:** Smart accounts can implement advanced security measures like multi-factor authentication and social recovery.
- **Developer Flexibility:** Developers have greater freedom to build innovative applications and services on top of ZKsync.

## Introduction to Paymasters

We’ve learned the benefits of Account Abstraction, now let’s see how we can leverage account abstraction to solve the challenging UX problems presented by blockchain.

Think about Blockchain + User Experience, well you can’t right? Because that’s the worst part about the blockchain, the user experience especially when it comes to onboarding new users adds so much friction because of the difficulty of getting used to the new set of concepts that comes with application on blockchain right? Well, ZKsync along with its Native Account Abstraction introduces Paymasters which are specialized smart contract that can facilitate gasless transactions or even allow users to pay gas fees in any ERC20 tokens. This approach enhances the usability of certain applications. 

So, the two most important things about Paymaster are:

1. They pay gas fees for users.
2. They allow users to pay fees in ERC20 tokens.

## Interacting with Paymasters

![zksync (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee2c7c28-76fb-4a59-8171-1770f66e7cef)

In ZKsync, when interacting with Paymasters, developers must provide the non-zero Paymaster address in the transaction, and include the data using the `paymasterInput` field. Paymasters in ZKsync can interact with any storage slot, whereas EIP4337 cannot. To maintain integrity ZKsync implements a similar reputation scoring system to EIP4337 and does not limit Paymasters to rules like the last successful verification or consistent slot access pattern

Okay let’s take an example to understand this concept, 

Imagine a Paymaster as a helpful friend who can pay for your transaction fees. When you want to use this friend's help in ZKsync, you need to:

- Mention your friend's address (the Paymaster address) in your transaction
- Include a note (paymasterInput) explaining how you want their help

In ZKsync, these helpful friends (Paymasters) have more freedom to do things. They can look at and change any information they need to help you. This is different from your other friends (EIP-4337) where these friends are more restricted in what they can do.

To make sure these helpful friends don't cause trouble, ZKsync uses a scoring system, kind of like a trust score.

and also, it doesn't force them to wait a certain time between helping people(last successful verification) or restrict them to only looking at certain information in a specific way (consistent slot access pattern).

## Key features enabled by Paymasters

Let’s explore the important features of Paymaster.

1. **Custom Payment Methods:** Haven’t we all been in a situation where we need to pay gas fees but we have another ERC20 token but not ETH? Traditionally, whenever you make a transaction, you would need ETH to cover transaction fees. But with Paymaster, you can use other ERC20 tokens or even different assets. It's like having multiple payment options at your favorite store. 
2. **Fee Abstraction:** You can interact with a dApp without even thinking about gas fees. Paymaster handles it all behind the scenes, making your experience smooth and hassle-free.
- **Sponsor Transactions:** For specific transactions, the Paymaster can cover the fees entirely. Paymasters offers several options for sponsoring the transactions as well
    - Paymasters can sponsor the gas fees for users that have a specific NFT.
    - Paymasters can sponsor the gas fees for the first 10 transactions of each month.
- **Conditional Logic:** The Paymaster isn’t just sponsoring fees blindly. It can be programmed to check various conditions before sponsoring a transaction. It verifies your token balance, checks the type of transaction, or follows any custom rules set by the dApp developer. It’s smart and adaptable!

## That’s a wrap

The native account abstraction system allows you a lot of flexibility and ease. You don’t have to manage the private keys but only login and the system manages everything. And the Paymaster in ZKsync makes blockchain interactions more accessible and gas-free. Next, we will set up our environment to code.
