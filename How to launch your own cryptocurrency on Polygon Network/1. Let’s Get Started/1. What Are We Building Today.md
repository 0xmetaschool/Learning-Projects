# What Are We Building Today?

Hey Metaschool fam! Today, we’re diving into something super exciting – creating our very own Cryptocurrency on the **Polygon Network** in just **30 minutes**! ⏳💰

### 🤔 Why Are We Building This?

The crypto space is booming, and launching a token is one of the best ways to dive into Web3 development. But here’s the deal – launching on Ethereum can be **super expensive** due to high gas fees. That’s where **Polygon** comes in! 🚀

Polygon is a **Layer-2 scaling solution** for Ethereum that makes transactions **faster, cheaper, and more efficient**. That means you can deploy your token without spending a fortune and provide users with a **seamless** experience.

### 🔥 Why Choose Polygon Over Ethereum?

Good question! Here’s why building on Polygon is a **game-changer**:

✅ **99% Cheaper** – Deploying a token on Polygon costs a fraction of Ethereum’s gas fees.
✅ **Blazing Fast** – Transactions are processed in seconds, not minutes.
✅ **EVM Compatible** – Easily migrate your Ethereum projects to Polygon.
✅ **Eco-Friendly** – Uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, reducing energy consumption.

Now, let’s roll up our sleeves and **launch your very own token**! Who knows – your token might be the next **Shiba Inu** or **Safemoon**! 🐶🚀

### 📚 Course Overview

Here’s the roadmap for this tutorial:

1. **Understand Polygon & Its Benefits**
2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
3. **Write a Smart Contract for Your Token**
4. **Deploy Your Token on Polygon**
5. **Verify & Interact with Your Token**

This is a **hands-on** tutorial, so expect to get your hands dirty with **Solidity** and **Polygon’s blockchain tools**! 🛠️

### 🧰 The Tech Stack

We’ll be using:

- **Solidity** – To write the smart contract
- **Remix IDE** – To code and deploy the contract
- **MetaMask** – To interact with the blockchain
- **Polygon Amoy Testnet** – For deployment
- **OpenZeppelin** – For standard token contracts
