# Writing smart Contract

## Setting Up MetaMask and the Amoy Testnet

Before we dive into writing smart contracts in Remix IDE, you'll need to set up MetaMask and add the Amoy testnet to it. This setup allows you to deploy and test your smart contracts in a safe, simulated environment that mimics the Polygon blockchain without using real ETH.

### What is MetaMask?

MetaMask is your gateway to the decentralized world! It’s a crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you:

1. Store and manage Polygon and ERC-20 tokens
2. Interact with decentralized applications (dApps) like Remix IDE
3. Send and receive cryptocurrency
4. Access multiple blockchain networks, including testnets like Amoy

Think of MetaMask as your digital passport, giving you access to your blockchain identity (wallet address) and assets across different networks. Without it, you can’t interact with smart contracts or dApps!

### Setting Up MetaMask

Ready to get started? Follow these simple steps to set up your MetaMask wallet:

1. **Install MetaMask**:
    - Go to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download.html) and install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
    - After installation, click the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar to launch the wallet.
2. **Create a New Wallet**:
    - Open MetaMask and click **Get Started**.

    - Select **Create a Wallet** and follow the on-screen instructions.
    - Don’t forget to save your seed phrase somewhere secure! It’s your recovery key for restoring your wallet if needed.
3. **Set a Strong Password**:
    - Choose a strong password to protect your wallet. Make sure it's unique and secure.
4. **Backup Your Seed Phrase**:

- MetaMask will display a 12-word seed phrase. Write it down and keep it safe—this is your lifeline to recovering your wallet if anything goes wrong.
1. **Start Using MetaMask**:
    - Once set up, you can manage your ETH, tokens, and interact with dApps.

### Adding Amoy Testnet to MetaMask

Now that MetaMask is set up, let's add the Amoy testnet to test your smart contracts without risking real assets. Here's how you do it:

1. **Open MetaMask**:
    - Click the MetaMask extension icon in your browser to open the wallet.
2. **Go to Settings**:
    - Click on the **three lines** (hamburger menu) in the top-left corner, then select **Settings**.
3. **Networks**:
    - In the settings menu, click on **Networks**, then choose **Add Network**.
4. **Enter Amoy Testnet Details**:
    - In the **Add Network** form, enter the following information:
        
        ![image.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/How%20to%20launch%20your%20own%20cryptocurrency%20on%20Polygon%20Network/1.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Started/Writing%20smart%20Contract/image%202.webp?raw=true)
        
    - **Network Name**: Amoy Testnet
    - **New RPC URL**: (You’ll get this URL from your testnet provider)
    - **Chain ID**: (Check with the provider for this number)
    - **Currency Symbol**: AMOY (or whatever the testnet’s native token symbol is)
    - **Block Explorer URL**: (Optional, if available)
    - Once you've entered the details, click **Save**.
5. **Switch to Amoy Testnet**:
    - After adding the Amoy Testnet, switch to it by selecting **Amoy Testnet** from the network dropdown in MetaMask.

Now you're all set to interact with the Amoy testnet! Connect MetaMask to Remix, and you'll be ready to deploy and test your smart contracts without the need for real ETH. 🚀

## Let's Dive Into Remix IDE

Alright, fam! Now it's time to **get our hands dirty** and set up Remix IDE to deploy our token. Follow these steps carefully, and in no time, you'll have your very own token ready to roll! 🎉

### 🛠 Setting Up Remix IDE

1. Head over to [**Remix IDE**](http://remix.ethereum.org/) or open the Remix desktop app, whichever works best for you.
2. Click on **Create Workspace** at the top of your File Explorer panel.

![https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/Vyu5rUvNgtyZG5pi47LN2OSp9Ke7Ac8fit4DqOIS.png](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/Vyu5rUvNgtyZG5pi47LN2OSp9Ke7Ac8fit4DqOIS.png)

1. A popup will appear – give your workspace a cool name (no spaces allowed) and select **OpenZeppelin ERC20** as the template.
2. Click **OK** to save and create your new workspace.

### 📜 Exploring Your Smart Contract

Now, let's locate your ERC20 contract:

1. Click on **SampleERC20.sol** under the `contracts` folder in your Remix File Explorer.
2. You'll see an ERC20 token smart contract written in Solidity.
3. Before we tweak it, let's break down what’s happening in the code! 🧑🏽‍🏫

![https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/vPYMZJUXZzZchk1nDwbgu692mkQZh591P2xCmHBb.png](https://metaschool.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/vPYMZJUXZzZchk1nDwbgu692mkQZh591P2xCmHBb.png)

I know, I know – **too much theory** 😃, but trust me, it's worth understanding before we jump into editing!

### ✨ Breaking Down the Code

- **Line 1:** Defines the **license type** (GPL-3.0). Different licenses like MIT, Apache, GPL exist, but we’ll stick to GPL-3.0.
- **Line 2:** Specifies the Solidity version (**0.7.0 to 0.9.0**) to prevent compatibility issues.
- **Line 3:** Imports the **OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract**, which provides the standard token functions like `balanceOf()`, `transfer()`, etc.
- **Line 4:** Declares a **contract** named `SampleERC20`, which inherits all functions from ERC20.sol.
- **Line 5:** The **constructor function** sets the token’s name and symbol when deployed.

### 🛠 Time to Edit The Code! 👩🏻‍💻

Now, let’s customize it to create **your own token**:

1. **Modify the Constructor:**
    - Replace `"TestToken"` with **your token’s name**.
    - Replace `"TEST"` with **your token’s symbol**.
2. **Add This Minting Function:** 👇🏼

```solidity
_mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());

```

💡 This function **mints** 1,000,000 tokens to the deployer (`msg.sender`). The `decimals()` function ensures the total supply accounts for the standard **18 decimal places**.

### 🎯 Final Smart Contract Code 👇🏼

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract SampleERC20 is ERC20 {
    constructor () ERC20("YourTokenName", "YTN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

### 🚰 Getting Test MATIC from the Amoy Faucet

Before you deploy your token, you'll need some **test MATIC** to cover gas fees on the **Amoy testnet**. Follow these steps to get free test MATIC:

1. **Go to the Amoy Faucet** – Visit [Polygon Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy).

![image.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/How%20to%20launch%20your%20own%20cryptocurrency%20on%20Polygon%20Network/1.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Started/Writing%20smart%20Contract/image%203.webp?raw=true)

1. **Select Amoy Testnet** – Make sure your wallet is set to **Polygon Amoy Testnet**.
2. **Paste your MetaMask Account address**
3. **Request Test MATIC** – Click the button to claim **test MATIC** (you might need to verify via social media).
4. **Wait for Confirmation** – Within a few minutes, your wallet should receive test MATIC.

### 🚀 Deploying Your Token

- Copy the code and **replace** `YourTokenName` and `YTN` with your actual token name and symbol.
- Now, you're all set to deploy! 💪

Next up – **deploying the contract** and making your token **live** on the Polygon network! 🚀
