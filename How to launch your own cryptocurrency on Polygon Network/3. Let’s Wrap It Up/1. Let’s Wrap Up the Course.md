# Let’s Wrap Up the Course

What an amazing ride! 🎉 You’ve come a long way in learning how to launch your very own cryptocurrency on the **Polygon Network**. Let’s take a moment to reflect on everything you've achieved:

## 1. The Polygon Network

You’ve gained a solid understanding of Polygon and its key benefits:

- **Polygon's Role in the Crypto Space:** You learned how Polygon acts as a Layer-2 scaling solution, providing faster, cheaper, and more efficient blockchain transactions.
- **Why Choose Polygon Over Ethereum:** You discovered the advantages of building on Polygon, including its **low gas fees**, **high-speed transactions**, and **EVM compatibility**.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

You’ve set up everything you need to get started:

- **MetaMask Wallet:** You installed and configured MetaMask to interact with Polygon’s blockchain.
- **Polygon Amoy Testnet:** You learned how to use the Amoy Testnet for deploying and testing your token before going live.
- **Remix IDE & OpenZeppelin:** You explored how to use Remix for writing and deploying smart contracts, and you made use of OpenZeppelin for robust token standards.

## 3. Writing Your Smart Contract

You got your hands dirty with **Solidity** to write your own smart contract for a custom token. This is a key skill to take with you into the world of Web3 development!

## 4. Deploying Your Token

You followed the steps to deploy your token on Polygon’s **Amoy Testnet**, ensuring that everything was working perfectly before going live.
