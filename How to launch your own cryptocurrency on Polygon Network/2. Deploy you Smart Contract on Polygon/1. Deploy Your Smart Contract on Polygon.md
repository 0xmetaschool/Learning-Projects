# Deploy Your Smart Contract on Polygon

It‚Äôs time to **launch your token** on the **Amoy Testnet**! üéâ You‚Äôre just a few steps away from seeing your very own cryptocurrency live and kicking. Ready to take your token to the blockchain? Let‚Äôs do this!

### Here‚Äôs What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up Remix for Deployment üõ†Ô∏è

Before we hit the deploy button, let's get everything in place:

- **Compile Your Contract**: In **Remix**, head to the **Solidity Compiler** tab and click **Compile SampleERC20.sol**. This will check your contract for any errors and ensure it's ready for deployment.

- **Choose the Right Environment**: In the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select **Injected Web3** as the environment. This connects Remix with your **MetaMask** wallet, allowing you to deploy directly from there.

- A **MetaMask popup** will appear asking you to connect your wallet. Make sure you‚Äôre on the **Amoy Testnet**  and select the account where you received your free testnet MATIC from the faucet.

### 2. Deploy Your Token üöÄ

Ready to launch your token? Let‚Äôs go:

- **Click on Deploy**: Hit the **Deploy** button in Remix to launch your token on the Amoy Testnet. This will trigger a transaction through MetaMask.

### 3. Check Your Token on the Amoy Explorer

Let‚Äôs confirm that everything is running smoothly:

1. **Go to the Amoy Testnet Explorer**: Head over to the **Amoy Polygon Explorer** (check for the correct URL with your testnet provider).
2. **Search for Your Contract**: Paste your **contract address** into the search bar and hit Enter. You'll be able to see your deployed token and all the transaction details.
