# Setup Metamask

Welcome back!  So, you've completed learning about Celo? Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, you're going to learn how to set up the dev environment to run your code. We will now set up Metamask! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is development environment?

You now need a super cool environment to run our code in and you need to set it up!

For this tutorial, you will use Metamask wallet, Celo faucet, Open Zeppelin Contracts Wizard for writing contract and then Remix for compiling and deploying your token. Don’t worry, setting them is super easy and you will do it in no time!

### Steps

1. Open your MetaMask browser extension, scroll through networks and click on “Add Network” button.

    The following screen will appear after clicking the “Add Network” button.

2. Now click on the “Add a network manually” to add a new network to your MetaMask.

3. Now fill in the following details:
    1. **Network name**: Celo (Alfajores Testnet)
    2. **New RPC URL**: [https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org](https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/)
    3. **Chain ID**: `44787`
    4. **Currency symbol**: CELO
    5. **Block explorer URL**: [https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/)
4. Click on the “Save” button. Finally, click on “Switch to Celo (Alfajores Testnet)” button and switch to your newly added network.

## Fill your account with CELO tokens

Next we will fill your newly created Celo account with tokens using faucet. Here’s how you can do that:

### Steps

1. Copy your Celo account address.
2. Next, head over to [https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores), paste your copied address to the Account Address field and click on “Faucet” button.

3. In the next 2-5 minutes, your wallet will be filled with 0.5 Celo tokens.

## What is Open Zeppelin Contracts Wizard?

It is an interactive generator that helps you in building your contract instead of reinventing the wheel. You can also learn about the components offered in OpenZeppelin Contracts. 

## What is Remix?

Remix is like an all-in-one toolbox for developers, and it is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Here's the deal: Remix is all about making your life easier when you're working on creating smart contracts. It's open-source, which means it's free for everyone to use and improve. It's like having a special workspace just for writing and running programs in Solidity programming language.

## That’s a wrap

In next lesson, you will write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language that you will deploy on your Celo network using Remix IDE.
