# Deploy Your First ERC-20 Token on Celo

Welcome back! You did great in the last lesson, learning all about writing ERC-20 token in Solidity. In this lesson, you will learn to compile and deploy your token. Let’s start this awesome journey!

## Let’s compile, deploy and interact

So we opened our code in Remix in last lesson.

Next, let’s hover to the Solidity compiler. It’s the icon under the Search icon on the left hand.

Next, you’ll notice the compiler version set in the compiler is not right. Let’s select the auto compile flag, which will automatically set the version and compile your contract as well.

> **Note:** In your case, if the box is already selected don’t unselect it.

If you face the following error at your Remix IDE, go to Solidity compiler, click on “Advanced Configurations.” There, you’ll find “EVM version” set to “default.” Change the version to “paris” and compile the token again.

Let me show you where the EVM version is on Remix.

Now, I will show you how to deploy your token, but before that you need to connect Remix IDE to your Metamask account.

- Click on Ethereum icon that is after the compile icon in the left side bar.
- Click and scroll through the “Environment” bar and select “Injected Provider - Metamask.”
- The Metamask page will appear. Click on “Next” and “Connect” to finally connect your Metamask to Remix IDE.

Now, let’s look at this happening live.

Now, we will officially deploy our token.

- Click on “Deploy” button to deploy your contract.
- Click on “Confirm” to the confirm the transaction from your Metamask.

Let’s look at this happening live in the following GIF.

## Interact with token

Great work! I hope you have deployed your contract now. Now you need to interact with the token and add it to your Metamask. Let’s jump into it right away.

Let’s go to the “Deployed Contracts” section and then do the following:

- Expand `mint` function.
- Copy your account address and paste it in `to` parameter.
- Add amout of `100` or any other amount you want to `amount` parameter.
- Click on transact button.
- Click on Confirm to approve the transaction.
- You will see the successful transaction completed in the logs.

Open your Metamask and you will see Mint transaction under your Activity tab.

Now we’re almost at our last step. Copy your contract address by clicking on the copy address of your contract under Deployed Contracts.

Head over to [https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) and paste your contract address to find out more information of your recently deployed token.

## That’s a wrap

Phew! You’ve done it! It was a long process but I’m so glad that you made it this far! And I salute your patience for following each and every step. That’s pretty much it for our course. In next lesson, we will wrap up our course and give you an overview of what you have learned so far.
