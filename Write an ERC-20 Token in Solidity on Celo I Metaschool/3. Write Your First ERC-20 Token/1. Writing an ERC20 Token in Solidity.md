# Writing an ERC20 Token in Solidity

Hey folks, welcome back! You've done an awesome job making it this far in the course. Till now, you've learned about Celo and set up the development environment.

Now, you’re just going to dive right into the project.

## Writing ERC20 token

Let’s build a simple ERC20 token in Solidity programming language with a mint functionality.

1. Head over to [Open Zeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/wizard).
2. Select `ERC20` as this is the type of contract we want to build.

1. Let’s name our token. I’ll be calling it `PepeToken` with `Pepe` as the symbol.
2. Next, I will select the features for our token. I want our token to be mintable, so let’s select it. Let it be “Ownable” so that you can mint new tokens and distribute them as you want.
3. After this click on “Open in Remix”.

## Code explanation

Let’s go through the code before deploying it.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
```

- First line is just a fancy comment that specifies the licensing right of the smart contract and this specific line gives you and everyone else the freedom to use this smart contract freely :).
- Second line is the version of the Solidity compiler that I want my contract to use. I’m basically telling the compiler to only use `0.8.9` or higher version, but not the lower version.

Next, I imported the ERC20 token and Ownable from the Open Zeppelin library.

```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```

These imports allow you to access all of the functionalities written in `ERC20.sol` file and `Ownable.sol` that are in OpenZeppelin. OpenZeppelin is an open-source framework that helps build secure smart contracts. It provides variety of smart contracts, tokens and multiple other functionalities to make our life easier.

```
contract PepeToken is ERC20, Ownable {
```

This line defines the contract named `PepeToken` which inherits `ERC20` and `Ownable` using `is` keyword.

```
constructor() ERC20("PepeToken", "Pepe") {}
```

Here we passed the arguments to the constructor.

```
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
```

This is a function definition that mints an amount to the address provided. 

## Complete code

In case you need complete code, here it is:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.2/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.2/access/Ownable.sol";

contract PepeToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("PepeToken", "Pepe") {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

## That’s a wrap up

Great job! You are done with writing and understanding the ERC20 token in Solidity programming language.

In the next lesson, you'll compile and deploy this token and see what you’ll get! Don’t forget to submit your assignments otherwise I will be sad.
