# üèõÔ∏è What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone üåà, today we (Ismail, Tanishq and Metaschool team) are so excited to be building a new dApp with you today ‚Äì the Twitter dApp.

So what are we building today? Today we're gonna build a twitter clone which will be a decentralized version of twitter.

But why are we building it? Recently, there has been a constant debate regarding data privacy, ownership and advertising revenues of social media platforms. It is indeed true that the top ten tech companies in the world control most of the digital data globally. This means that we don‚Äôt have rights and control to our privacy, data and the decisions we make in our daily lives.

It is now much more important than ever that we use decentralized internet (web3) as a tool to create a space where users can actually own and control their data rather than being sold by giants for advertising revenue. It is for this very reason I felt like while you are learning about Solidity and the web3 ecosystem, why don‚Äôt we attempt to create a decentralized version of Twitter (a Twitter DApp üê¶).

## **Course overview**

Sooo!! We are building a Twitter dApp today. The app will have the following functionality.

1.  Sign-in via Twitter using Web3Auth
2.  Write a tweet as NFT
3.  Upvote and Comment on a tweet
4.  Buy a tweet on OpenSea.
5.  Interoperability of the DApp with Torus Wallet and Wallet Connect

This will be a very informative course on how to deploy an end to end application from scratch!

**There are 3 main modules to any E2E Application**

1.  **Smart Contracts**
2.  **Backend**
3.  **Frontend**

Ours will be a web3 centric course where we will spend most of our time exploring all of the web3 aspects of the DApp.

This will majorly fall under the Smart Contract & The Backend section.

We will try to keep our discussion about the frontend brief, and focused on the web3 integration.

All of the code for any section in this tutorial is available on our  [Github](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/).

So feel free to consult it if you wish to dive deeper into the frontend!

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for advance web3 developers who wish to learn about the applications of NFT and how to create a End to End application on blockchain.


## Prerequisites
- Node - Download [Node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- VSCode - Download [VScode from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Metamask account - Download [Metamask from here](https://metamask.io/)
- Twitter dApp Boilerplate - Clone [Boilerplate from here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/twitter-dapp-boilerplate)


**Note**: We will be introducing two different web3 wallets in the tutorial today

1.  **Metamask**  - We will use this wallet to deploy our smart contract using the Remix IDE. For the purpose of this tutorial we will assume you have MetaMask already set up in your browser
2.  **Torus Wallet**  - We will be using the Torus wallet to interact with the frontend, and integrate with the Web3Auth framework. We will be covering Torus Wallet in detail later on, so don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt know anything about this :)

## Proof of completion
If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
