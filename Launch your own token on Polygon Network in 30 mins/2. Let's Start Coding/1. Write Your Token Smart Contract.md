# Write Your Token Smart Contract

Welcome back! I’m so proud of you for coming this far. In this lesson, we will dive into the coding part and create an ERC20 token.

## Let's go to Remix IDE

- Go to [http://remix.ethereum.org/](http://remix.ethereum.org/) or open Remix desktop app anything you prefer
- Click on create file at the top of your file explorer panel and create MyToken.sol
- Now **click on MyToken.sol** and let’s add some code

So, your MyToken will have the following code and we will use the OpenZeppelin library to write our smart contract and as you can see we wrote only 5-6 lines to make our token!

The final code will look like this.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
	constructor () ERC20("Mango Coin", "Mango") {
		_mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
	}
}
```

You can copy this code and change `Mango Coin` and `Mango` with the name of your token and symbol.

Now, onto the next lesson!
