##### Understanding Polygon Network

Hey fam, I’m Aswin 👋🏼

Today we will learn about creating your own token in 30 mins, and it will be a step by step process.

I will name my token 🥭 **Mango Token.** You can have your own name as per your choice.

So, I guess we are good to go. 

Hold tight because we will have a working token ready in the next 30 minutes.

But, before we start we need to understand a few things and I promise it won’t be a long, boring history class lecture!

### What is Polygon Network?

Polygon Network is a Layer-2 chain of Ethereum, built to improve speed, reduce fees and increase productivity.

### What makes Polygon better than Ethereum?

I think you might be having this same question right? so building on Polygon can reduce the transaction fees by more than 99% thus you can deploy your token at a cost way lower than Ethereum. 

Finally we don’t need to have a lot of money to launch a token 😉 but that’s not the best part, Polygon is very fast too so now your users can transact using your token faster and cheaper!

That's all you need to know.

Now let's get our things ready to launch a token, who knows maybe your token will be the next Shiba Inu or Safemoon.
