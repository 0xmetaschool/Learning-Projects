# Setting Up Your Environment

In the previous lesson you got the overview of this whole course but in this lesson we will setup the environment before getting started with the coding part (next lesson), for that,

1. First, we will setup Polygon testnet network with your MetaMask.
2. Then, we get some fake token using the Polygon faucet to pay for the transactions.

Let‚Äôs first quickly understand what is testnet.

## What is testnet?

A testnet is a version of a blockchain network that is used for testing purposes. It is essentially a copy of the main network, but it uses a different set of rules, and it is separate from the main network so that developers can experiment with new features without affecting the main network. Testnets are often used by developers to test new software or to test out new transactions before they are sent to the main network. Because testnets are not connected to the main network, they are not subject to the same rules and regulations, and they can be freely experimented with without any risk to the main network.

## Setting up the testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/80001](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001).
- Click on ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on ‚ÄúAdd to Metamask‚Äù.
- Click on Approve and then Switch network.

You will be successfully connected to Mumbai network. See in the following gif how I did it:

## Get some fake MATIC $$ ü§ë

Now its time to get some money!

- Copy your account address.
- Select¬†‚ÄùMumbai‚Äù as Network and¬†‚ÄùMATIC‚Äù as token.
- Head over to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
- Paste your wallet address.
- Finally, click on ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button.

This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can‚Äôt buy NFTs, or other assets via these MATIC.

## That‚Äôs a wrap

Guys we are just 10 mins away from creating our token! Excited, right?

So, we finished setting up everything we need for the deployment, let‚Äôs do some coding now! I will help you create your own token contract in just 5 lines!! NO JOKE!
