# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone 🌞, I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Polygon for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we will learn how to create your own Polygon token in 30 mins. It will be a simple, step-by-step process.

Why Polygon? Polygon is a layer-2 blockchain that helps solve many issues with the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon supports EVM and Solidity, which makes it the best choice for developers like you.

Not only this, Polygon commited $20 million to build web3 communities that can build on web3 and come up with scaling solutions. Polygon raised over $450,000 in 2019 in two rounds of startup, which shows how much promising the Polygon is and how much growth it will bring in web3 world.

Before we start, we need to understand a few things and trust me I'm not gonna bore you!

## Course overview

We will cover:

1. How to create an ERC20 token like Shiba Inu, Safemoon, Aave, etc.

- How to use OpenZeppelin library.
- How to use MetaMask to create your dApp.
- How to deploy on Polygon Testnet.

**Keep your momentum going! In lesson 3rd and 4th, we’ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can’t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about building their own blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain ecosystem because in this course we will focus more on creating your token on Polygon network and skip the theory part.

## Prerequisites

But that is not where it ends. In order to launch your token on Polygon Network, you must also be familiar with several tools and have them installed on your machine.

- Remix IDE - to write and deploy our code.
- OpenZeppelin - Polygon Network supports EVM so we will use ERC-20 standards.
- MetaMask - to interact with the Polygon Network.
- Some MATIC tokens - we can get it from the faucet.

**Don’t worry!** We will walk you through all tools and important installations in upcoming lessons. This is just the overview of the tools we will be using in the course.
