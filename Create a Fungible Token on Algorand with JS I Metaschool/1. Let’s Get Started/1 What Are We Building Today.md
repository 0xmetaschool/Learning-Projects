# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone 🔆 I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Algorand for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own fungible token using Javascript (JS) programming language and then deploying it on Algorand blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Algorand using JS.

Let’s look at how the token deployed looks on the Algo explorer by the end of the course.

Why Algorand? Algorand is the Layer-1 protocol that supports developing dApps, uses Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, is a sustainable green blockchain and is also in partnership with [ClimateTrade](https://climatetrade.com/). It is energy efficient as compared to other blockchains.

Not only this, Algorand is fast, secure and scalable: Algorand smart contracts operate at over 1,000TPS (transaction per second). A few recently launched projects of Algorand are [Folks Finance](https://folks.finance/), [Alammax](https://www.alammex.com/), [Pact](https://www.pact.fi/), [Opulous](https://opulous.org/), [Algomond](https://www.algomond.com/#/) and many more.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Algorand blockchain
2. Learn to write fungible token in Javascript
3. Set up development environment for Algorand and MyAlgo wallet
4. Deploy the JS smart contract to Algorand blockchain

**Keep your momentum going! In Lessons 5 and 6, I'll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can't wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about Algorand blockchain and how they can deploy smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and JS Programming language because in this course we will focus more on writing fungible token and deploying it on Algorand blockchain.

This course is a best fit for those who want to explore the web3 world but cannot figure out which blockchain they like the best. This course equips you with the basic knowledge of building and deploying a simple contract in Algorand. If you love building this smart contract then you are set to build major applications on this blockchain. Can’t wait to see you explore it later on!!

## Prerequisites

- [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Install Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any other IDE of your choice

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
