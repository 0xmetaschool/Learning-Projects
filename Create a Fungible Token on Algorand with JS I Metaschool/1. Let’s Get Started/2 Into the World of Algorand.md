# Into the World of Algorand

So hey folks, you just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That something new is, you guessed it, the Algorand blockchain!

## What the heck is Algorand?

So, what even is Algorand and why should you know about it?

Algorand has it all - decentralization, scalability, security, and environmental sustainability, without any compromises! It's like a futuristic, super-cool blockchain where we build amazing dApps and contracts together while taking care of our planet! ðŸŒ¿

The **Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM)** powers Algorand's smart contracts. It boasts compatibility with modern programming languages and supports advanced features such as functions, loops, and recursion. Thanks to its robust design, AVM can accommodate larger programs and provides additional opcodes. Every Algorand node runs the AVM, which includes a stack engine responsible for executing smart contracts. This design ensures that smart contracts run quickly, securely, and efficiently on the Algorand platform.

Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) offer a uniform Layer-1 solution for the representation of diverse asset types on the Algorand blockchain. These assets can be fungible, non-fungible, or even restricted in both fungible and non-fungible assets. ASA ensures a consistent and efficient approach to managing various assets within the Algorand ecosystem.

So what is Algorand currency? The platform uses ALGO tokens for completing any transaction on it. Executing transactions on Algorand is super affordable at just .001 ALGOs. 

If you're wondering about the programming languages compatible with Algorand, you'll be happy to know it's beginner-friendly. It supports the SDKs for the languages: Python, Java, Javascript, and Go.

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

In a nutshell, Algorand is an exciting new blockchain technology that offers decentralization, scalability, security, and environmental sustainability. The Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) and Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) are two key features that make Algorand stand out among other blockchains.
