# Deploy a Fungible Token

Kudos for making this far! Till now, you've written the code to create your token/asset. Now we are in final stage, yes, we will deploy the created asset in this lesson. So get ready!

## Deploy command

So open up your terminal and run the following command:

```jsx
node CreateAsset.js
```

This will show an output like below:

## Interact with token

Go to the Asset URL that was generated as your output, for me it was [https://testnet.explorer.perawallet.app/asset/592354835/](https://testnet.explorer.perawallet.app/asset/592354835/) and interact with your created token:

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

In this lesson, we learned how to deploy a fungible token and interact with it using the Asset URL generated in the output. 

You are now equipped with the basic knowledge of building and deploying a simple contract. The key takeaways are understanding how to send, receive, and interact with tokens using wallets and blockchain explorers. Now you can explore and build token applications in the evolving Algorand blockchain landscape.

Next, we will wrap up the course.
