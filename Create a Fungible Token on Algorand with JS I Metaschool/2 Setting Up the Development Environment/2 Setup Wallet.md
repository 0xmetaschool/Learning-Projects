# Setup Wallet

Greetings! So you have successfully created your wallet, it’s time to import it. Let’s start working on it right away.

## Setup Pera wallet

- Install Pera wallet on your mobile: [https://perawallet.app/](https://perawallet.app/).
    - If you encounter any issues while starting the app, kindly use a VPN.
- You will have three options on the welcome page. Select “Import an account.”
- Next, select the “Recover an account” button.
- Remember the passphrase generated when you ran the command `node CreateAccount.js` in the last lesson. It is the 25-word  recovery passphrase, you need to copy that.
