# History of Aptos

Hey there, fellow developers! We're super excited to have you here with us on this course.

Now, imagine we asked you to list the top three things you look for in a "Good" blockchain project. You might mention the number of pages in the white paper, how active the founders are on Twitter, or when they're planning their next airdrop or mainnet launch.

We get it — these factors are important! But there's one element that's often overlooked: a good origin story.

A solid origin story can tell you so much about a project. It reveals the vision behind the initiative, the problems it aims to solve, the people involved, and their motivations for driving the project forward.

So, as we embark on this epic quest to learn and master the Aptos blockchain, we think it would be fantastic to start with the story of Aptos and how it evolved into one of the most prominent blockchain protocols in the space.

So, let's just dive right in and discover not just the 'what' and the 'how,' but also the 'why' behind Aptos!

## A Facebook Project

Not so long ago, in 2019, Meta, formerly Facebook, officially announced that they were planning to launch a blockchain-based global payment system called Libra, with its stablecoin.

The idea was to make sending money across borders as cheap and easy as possible. You can imagine the buzz—it made people super excited and skeptical.

But the skepticism wasn't just from everyday folks; governments and regulators were on high alert, too. They started raising concerns right away. Could this huge project disrupt national currencies? What about the risks of money laundering? These concerns quickly turned into a massive storm of opposition to the project.

To calm things down, Facebook made some significant changes. They rebranded Libra as Diem, shifted their focus to single-currency stablecoins, and overhauled the project’s governance. But, even with these changes, the headwinds continued. Key partners started to back out, and Facebook, feeling the heat, began to waver.

By January 2022, it was over for the Diem Association. They sold their assets, officially putting an end to the project. But our story doesn't end there!

## A Bold Move

You see, many of the engineers and developers who spent years on the Diem project weren't about to just give up on the whole thing. Among them were Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching, who played pivotal roles in developing the Diem project, particularly in developing a crypto wallet called Novi Wallet.

They recognized the potential of the technology they had created, especially the Move programming language. Move, inspired by the Rust language, was created specifically for blockchain development and prioritized security and data verification to minimize potential errors and vulnerabilities.

Move's focus on safety wasn't just theoretical. It was born from real-world experience building Diem, where security flaws could have dire consequences in a financial context. Additionally, Move's design aimed to make it easier for developers to verify their smart contracts using Move Prover, adding another layer of protection and reliability to the applications built upon it.

Motivated by a desire to see their hard work realized, Shaikh, Ching, and others from the original Diem team founded Aptos Labs. This wasn't another rebranding exercise. It signified a focused evolution by building upon the core strengths of Diem. It also addressed the regulatory concerns and challenges that hampered Diem's success.

The Aptos mainnet officially launched on October 17, 2022.

The core motivations behind building the protocol can be distilled into these key points:

- **Scalability**: Aptos aims to handle significantly more transactions per second than older blockchains, positioning itself as a solution for large-scale adoption.
- **Developer Experience**: With Move and a focus on tooling, Aptos wants to make building decentralized applications a seamless and secure process.
- **User-Focused**: Recognizing that usability is key to mainstream blockchain usage, Aptos is prioritizing intuitive user interfaces and simplifying the complexities of the technology.

## **Funding the Vision**

Now, with great ideas comes greater funding. And if those ideas are carried by an experienced team, you might just raise a few hundred million dollars – even *before* launching your major product. Such was the case with Aptos. Even before their mainnet launch, Aptos Labs raised a massive $200 million in March 2022, followed by another $150 million in July of the same year. Investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), FTX Ventures, and Coinbase Ventures backed Aptos early on. This kind of funding demonstrates the confidence investors had in the project and its potential to make a real impact in the blockchain space.
