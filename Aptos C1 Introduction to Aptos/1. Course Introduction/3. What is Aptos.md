# What is Aptos?

Welcome back, my friend! Since you've chosen to dive into this course, you probably already know how quickly blockchain technology has skyrocketed. But have you ever stopped to think why it’s grown so fast, especially compared to other tech like the internet which took ages to catch on? It's pretty intriguing, right?

As you can see blockchain as a technology is growing faster than the internet itself. Hence, it is considered a revolution in the tech industry.

The magic of blockchain starts with some key features you've probably heard about while googling around: decentralization and transparency. Impressive, huh? But what is the reason why blockchain is yet to be mainstream? One major challenge is speed and scalability. Many blockchains struggle to process transactions quickly and efficiently, which can limit their real-world use.

In an era where we might ditch a website just because it loads slowly, speed and cost become big barriers when it comes to adopting new tech.

What's the best fix for this? A blockchain that's quicker, cheaper, and can scale up….

## Enter Aptos: A Faster, More Scalable Blockchain!

Aptos is a highly scalable and secure layer-1 blockchain designed to enable the creation of decentralized applications using Move, a new smart contract language focused on security and safety.

Aptos tackles these limitations (speed and scalability) with its innovative features like **parallel execution, resource-oriented architecture, the Move language**, etc. I don’t want to spill the beans now, so let’s move on to the next lesson. We'll delve deeper into these features and how they work in the upcoming lessons.

## Wrap Up

We hope this lesson gives you a good snapshot of what Aptos is all about and the standout features it brings to the table. Next up, we’ll explore some of the popular dApps that have been built on Aptos. Stay tuned to see how developers are leveraging Aptos to create cool applications!
