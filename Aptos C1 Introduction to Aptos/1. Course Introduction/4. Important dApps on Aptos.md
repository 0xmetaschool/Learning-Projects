# Important dApps on Aptos

Hey, there developers! If you are reading this then you already have read the origin of Aptos, went through the fundamentals of the protocol, and ended up here. In this lesson, we will be looking into some cool applications that are built on top of Aptos, so that you can get that much-needed inspiration to build some cool stuff on your own…

You see, a good number of useful applications is a sign of a healthy blockchain ecosystem and a large number of active users within those applications shows high adoption. The Aptos ecosystem has both a healthy number of applications and a high user count.

In this section, let’s just look at some of the star applications in the Aptos ecosystem and try to explore why they pretty much thrive thanks to Aptos.

## DApps on Aptos

Now, for the blockchain to become this hub of super cool applications, it needs to enable certain things for the developers who build the application and users who use that application. In the case of Aptos, as we already discussed in the previous lesson, it comes with features like Move language support, parallel transaction execution, modular architecture, and a novel data model approach which enables the protocol to have higher scalability, security, and transaction processing capability.

All this leads to a better development experience for the developer and a rich user experience for the end user. This makes the protocol a suitable playground for a variety of applications that cover a wide range of use cases from deFi, social media, token exchanges, and even games and marketplaces.

Here are some of the most in-demand categories of applications from the Aptos ecosystem.
