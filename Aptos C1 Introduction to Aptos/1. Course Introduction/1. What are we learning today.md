# What are We Learning Today?

Hey there fellas 👋, today marks the first day of our journey to learn and master the Aptos blockchain. In the Ohlone language, "Aptos" means "The People.” This meaning fits right in as Aptos is a Layer-1 blockchain for everyone.

Quick tip: Keeping an eye on official blockchain GitHub repos like Aptos can be incredibly rewarding. Many projects offer airdrops and incentives to active community members. Don't miss out - follow [Aptos on GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs)!

Before we attempt to create some cool DApps on the Aptos blockchain, it is important to understand the perks offered by Aptos. You cannot fully utilize a tool until you have a good understanding of the functionalities it has to offer.
