# Aptos Asset Standards

Hi Folks! The rise of blockchain technology has brought with it an array of digital tokens, each with its unique properties and applications. Two prominent categories of these tokens are **fungible** and **non-fungible** tokens.

Aptos used to rely on the “Aptos Coin standard” for fungible tokens and “Aptos Token” for NFTs But both of these standards used the Account resources data model for their implementation. In August 2023, Aptos introduced two new standards after a vote on Aptos Improvement Proposal-21 in July 2023.

Hence these two new standards were brought into effect.

1. **Aptos Fungible Asset Standard** for regular tokens, tokenized real-world assets, and in-game assets
2. **Aptos Digital Asset Standard** for NFTs

The new token standards would use Move’s object model, Yeah the same model we just talked about in the previous lesson. Deriving fungible assets out of objects allows for both a seamless developer experience but also simplifies application development time. Treating assets as objects allows developers to write all sorts of custom properties for them and save them as resources. Let’s understand these two standards briefly.

### **Aptos Fungible Asset Standard**

The new Aptos Fungible Asset Standard is a standard meant for simple, type-safe, and fungible assets based on an object model intending to replace the Aptos coin (legacy). So all the resources defined here are included in the object resource group and stored inside objects. There are two types of objects related to FA:

- Object<Metadata>: include information about the FA, such as name, symbol, and decimals.
- Object<FungibleStore>: store a specific amount of FA units. FAs are units that are interchangeable with others of the same metadata.

The different objects involved - Object<Metadata> and Object<FungibleStore> objects, and their relationships to accounts are shown in the diagram below:

We already discussed the fact that Metadata stores key details about the fungible asset, such as name, symbol, decimals, and other descriptive attributes and Fungible store is responsible for storing a specific amount of FA.

Each FungibleStore object has an owner. However, an owner may possess more than one store. Let’s say Alice wants to send some FA to Bob, how does she determine the correct destination? Additionally, what happens if Bob doesn't have a store yet?

To address these questions, the standard has been expanded to define primary and secondary stores.

1. **Primary Fungible Store**

The Primary Fungible Store is responsible for the main storage responsible for core functionalities of the fungible asset. It references Metadata for asset details and is linked to Alice as the owner, enabling her to perform operations like transferring tokens, minting, or burning.

- Each account owns **only one non-deletable** primary store per FA type.
- The address is derived deterministically from the account address and metadata object address using the sha256 hash function.
- If a primary store does not exist, it is created automatically when FA is deposited.
1. **Secondary Fungible Store**

The Secondary Fungible Store manages additional functionalities beyond basic asset management. It references Metadata for consistency in asset details and is linked to Alice as the owner, allowing her to use extended functionalities for complex scenarios like DeFi etc.

- Accounts can have multiple secondary stores.
- Addresses are non-deterministic, offering flexibility but requiring extra management effort.
- Secondary stores are theoretically deletable.

The Owner, Alice owns and controls both the Primary and Secondary Fungible Stores, conducting operations like sending and receiving tokens, and managing secondary stores for advanced use cases. We will be learning the implementation and in-depth usage of this standard in the upcoming courses. You just need to get familiar with the standards for the time being.

### Aptos Digital Asset Standard

An NFT is a non-fungible token or data stored on a blockchain that uniquely defines ownership of an asset. NFTs are typically defined using the following properties:

- name: The name of the asset. It must be unique within a collection.
- description: The description of the asset.
- uri: A URL pointer to off-chain for more information about the asset. The asset could be media such as an image or video or more metadata.
- supply: The total number of units of this NFT. Many NFTs have only a single supply, while those that have more than one are referred to as editions.

Each NFT belongs to a specific collection, acting as a container for related tokens. Now, consider this: A collection is an object with its own address and various resources, just like each token within a collection. That's right: every Collection and NFT on the Aptos blockchain has its own unique address, allowing you to manipulate them individually and add properties as needed.

Each collection has a similar set of attributes:

- name: The name of the collection. The name must be unique within the creator's account.
- description: The description of the collection.
- uri: A URL pointer to off-chain for more information about the asset. The asset could be media such as an image or video or more metadata.
- supply: The total number of NFTs in this collection.
- maximum: The maximum number of NFTs that this collection can have. If the maximum is set to 0, then the supply is not tracked.

The new Aptos Digital Asset Standard allows:

- Rich, flexible assets and collectibles.
- Easy enhancement of base functionality to provide richer custom functionalities.

Digital Asset (DA) is also recommended for any new collections or protocols that want to build NFT or semi-fungible tokens. We’ll suggest that you check out [Topaz.so - Aptos NFT Marketplace](https://www.topaz.so/) .

### That’s a wrap

So in summary, Aptos has introduced new token standards: the Aptos Fungible Asset Standard and Aptos Digital Asset Standard. These standards leverage Move's object model for seamless development and simplified applications. Each NFT and collection now has a unique address on the Aptos blockchain for individual manipulation. We’ll see you in the next lesson.
