# How Does Aptos Even Work?

Hey! Back for another round of Aptos knowledge?

Okay let’s do a quick recap, we've covered what Aptos is and what it's all about, but you might be wondering: how does this whole thing work?

This is where things get interesting. As developers, we naturally love diving into the nitty-gritty of how something is built. ️In this lesson, we're going to take a deep dive into the core workings of the Aptos platform.

Okay now buckle up! This lesson is going to be a bit detailed but hold tight as I will walk you through every detail with examples you can relate to.

## How Does Aptos Work?

We've been exploring what is Aptos, its history, etc, but you might be curious: what makes this tick?

![image7.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C1%20Introduction%20to%20Aptos/%20How%20Does%20Aptos%20Even%20Work/image7.webp?raw=true)

Well, several crucial parts make the Aptos architecture so novel and innovative, We have so many reasons to build on Aptos and we know that we can’t walk you through all the parts here in this course but let’s dig deep into three fundamental parts of the Aptos blockchain…

1. Move language
2. Block-STM
3. Aptos Data Model

## Move Language

We have already read about Move language and its origin right? But you might be wondering what’s so special about it that blockchain like Aptos is using it to allow developers to build applications on top of it. Let’s delve into it…

![image17.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C1%20Introduction%20to%20Aptos/%20How%20Does%20Aptos%20Even%20Work/image17.webp?raw=true)

From what we have understood till now, one of the key ideas behind Move is to have a language that provides robust safety and security for handling digital assets like cryptocurrencies. It does this through a novel approach called resource-oriented design.

Okay, these might sound technical but let us break it down for you..

### Resource-Oriented Structure

You know how when you were a kid, you had that special binder for your Pokemon card collection? You couldn't just print out copies of the rare cards, they had to be the real deal. Well, Move treats digital assets kind of like those collectible Pokemon cards.

With Move, developers define custom "resource" types that represent scarce digital items like cryptocurrencies or NFTs.

And here's the cool part - the Move language itself enforces the scarcity rules, like the Pokemon cards and you keep these cards in those binder pockets, one card in one pocket. You can't just make unlimited copies, because Move codes those scarcity rules into the resource types. Here the binder pockets are the resources storage where you store your resources.

In short “resources” in Move are custom types that can never be copied or implicitly discarded.

### Enhanced Security

Imagine you're going on a road trip and packing for the first time. You want to make sure you bring all the essentials and nothing gets lost or stolen along the way. What do you do?

For regular programming languages, it's like using a duffel bag. You can stuff all your things in there, but it's easy for items to go missing or for someone to reach in and take things without you noticing. Not very secure!

Move is like using one of those fancy, locked suitcases specifically designed for secure travel. It has a few key security features:

- A lock with a combination code that only you know. This is like Move's "formal verifiability" - it uses advanced logic to mathematically prove your digital assets are packaged up correctly.
- Reinforced corners and zippers to prevent break-ins. That's similar to Move's built-in protections against common security attacks like re-entrancy exploits.
- Careful organization with segmented compartments for different items. In Move, resource types enforce clear ownership to make sure every resource has only a single owner.

Well, that’s it about the Move language, it is time to move on to learn about Block-STM, we are already so excited to talk about it as this is considered to be one of the few technologies in the blockchain industry that enable parallel transactions in blockchains. Okay, that’s enough for now let us walk you through how awesome this tech is..

## Block-STM

Remember our discussion about building applications on Aptos? It's like running a busy grocery store. You want to serve customers (process transactions) quickly and efficiently, especially during peak hours. But what if, during these rush times, the checkout line gets so long that customers get frustrated and even abandon their carts (transactions)? This can happen on some blockchains where transactions are processed one by one, leading to high gas fees during peak usage. Block-STM acts as your secret weapon for handling these checkout line nightmares.

Okay, I know this might sound a little overwhelming so let’s start from the beginning, why this tech is needed in the first place?

### The Challenge: Single Lane, Long Wait

Imagine stores having one cashier processing customers one by one (sequential processing). This can lead to long lines and frustrated customers, especially when everyone wants to check out at the same time. (This is similar to how transactions are processed on some blockchains). In layman's terms, this is how blockchains like Ethereum process their transactions, so during peak hours, all the transactions get queued up as the transactions are processed one by another and thus the gas fees go crazyyy high!

### Block-STM to the Rescue: Multiple Checkout Lanes

Block-STM is like having multiple cashiers working simultaneously (parallel processing within a block). Customers can get in different lines and be served concurrently, significantly reducing wait times. This is how Aptos processes the transactions in parallel!

### But Wait, What’s the Catch?

Not all groceries (Blockchain Data) are the same. Some might require more scanning or bagging (complex transactions). Block-STM is smart – it can group similar items (identify dependencies) and send them to the most appropriate cashier (optimize scheduling). This ensures even large orders are processed efficiently.

Next, let’s move to understanding the data model and learn the difference between the traditional data model and Aptos data model.

### Traditional Data Model: The Messy Garage

Imagine showing your friend around your garage where you keep all your car stuff, but it's a total mess:

- Engine tools are buried under piles of old newspapers.
- Paint codes are on a sticky note somewhere under a stack of pizza boxes.
- Wheels are just rolling around the floor.
- Gadgets and wires are stuffed into any drawer with space.

You might chuckle and say, "It's a disaster, right? Every time I need something, I have to dig through all this. It takes forever, and half the time, I end up just buying new stuff because I can't find the old" lol.

This chaos is what dealing with the traditional data model used to be like. Everything was everywhere—your data and resources were scattered across your account storage. It was hard to find and manage because:

- Important things were hidden in places you wouldn't think to look.
- You had to sort through everything just to find one thing, which was slow and frustrating.

### Aptos Object Model: The Neat Toolbox

Now, imagine you decide to completely overhaul your garage into a neat, organized space equipped with a state-of-the-art toolbox:

**Definition of Aptos Object Model:**

The Aptos Object Model is an advanced organizational system for blockchain data. It prioritizes organization and security by grouping related resources into single addresses. Think of it like a well-organized toolbox – everything has its designated spot, wrenches with wrenches, screwdrivers together. Similarly, the Aptos Object Model keeps your blockchain data neatly organized in one place. This approach unlocks several key benefits:

- **Simplified Management:** Data is grouped logically, making complex information like tokens or NFTs a breeze to access and manage. No more hunting around for specific data points scattered across the blockchain.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** Security gets a boost! You have granular control over who sees or interacts with specific data elements within an object this is similar to access control in Solidity. Think of it like assigning permissions for different tools in your toolbox – only authorized users get to touch the fancy screwdriver set.

With the Aptos object model, managing blockchain resources is as straightforward as finding a tool in a well-organized toolbox. It makes everything easier, from everyday tasks to keeping everything secure and up-to-date. This model is all about making your life easier, just like a tidy garage does.

And that’s it…congratulations you have been amazing till now and we know this lesson was information savvy so we will be continuing with Aptos Assets standards in the next lesson!
