# Aptos vs Non-Move-Based Chains

Hey, let's dive into what makes Aptos stand out from the crowd in the world of blockchain! Trust me, understanding this will help you see why Aptos is the one you’d wanna work with.

If you want to size up something in the blockchain world, you've got to stack it against the best, right? And in this arena, EVM chains stand tall as the benchmark of excellence, yeah I know due to gas fees it’s hard to scale your apps on top of EVM chains but we need to understand that these blockchains have been battle-tested over time. Let's seize this opportunity to compare Aptos and Non-Move-based chains. We will be comparing these three juggernauts on these parameters.

## Transaction Speed

Aptos completely obliterates EVM chains like Ethereum and Non-Move-based chains like Solana when it comes to transaction speed. Let’s take an example of Ethereum which may not be strictly single-threaded, its core transaction processing for block validation happens sequentially. This means transactions are processed one after another, limiting its overall throughput.

Aptos on the other hand, utilizes its AptosBFT (the consensus protocol) and Block-STM (Software Transactional Memory) for parallel transaction processing. Block-STM allows validated transactions within a block to be executed simultaneously on all 16 cores, significantly accelerating transaction speed. We will talk about Block-STM in the coming lessons so don’t worry!

EVM chains like Ethereum can handle around **15 transactions per second (TPS)**, and Binance can handle around **55 - 60** **transactions per second (TPS)** whereas Aptos can handle over **150,000 transactions per second (TPS).** When it comes to transaction confirmation time, Aptos takes less than a second whereas EVM chains can go up to 5 minutes.

Now, let’s take a look at another non-Moved-based chain, Solana, it can handle around **65000 transactions per second (TPS)** whereas as we already mentioned Aptos can handle over 150,000 transactions per second (TPS). Also, Solana takes 3 - 4 seconds whereas Aptos takes less than a second to process the transaction.

## Stability and Reliability

EVM chains have been around since 2015 and have a proven track record of stability. It has survived multiple network upgrades and has never suffered a major security breach. It is secured by a vast network of miners, making it highly resistant to attacks. However, its high usage and limited scalability can cause EVM chains like Ethereum to become congested.

Aptos is a newer blockchain specifically designed for high transaction throughput and low latency. When it comes to raw transaction speed and efficiency, AptosBFT shows potential advantages over the EVM chain’s PoS. Aptos is a relatively new blockchain with a limited track record, it shows a lot of promise but the EVM chain is well-known in terms of stability due to its long history and battle-tested network.

## User Experience and Fees

EVM chain's dominance comes with a price - slow transaction times and high fees can frustrate users. Sometimes the fee itself can be more than the transaction value so scalability is frowned upon due to the high gas fees.

Aptos, on the other hand, is built for speed and scalability. This translates to potentially much faster transactions and significantly lower fees compared to a congested EVM chain. While Aptos is a new player with a developing ecosystem, it offers an exciting glimpse into a future where blockchain interactions are faster, smoother, and more affordable.

## Wrap Up

Aptos sets itself apart with its impressive transaction speeds, innovative design, and user-focused approach. While competing with established platforms, Aptos demonstrates good reliability and efficiency. Its advanced hardware and fail-proof architecture position Aptos as a promising contender in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Next up, we will go through the advantages of Aptos and how it can make you stand out from the crowd.
