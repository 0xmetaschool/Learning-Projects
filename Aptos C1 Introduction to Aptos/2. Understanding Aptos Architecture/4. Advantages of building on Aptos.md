# Advantages of building on Aptos

## Reasons for Building on Aptos

Without further ado, let's see the reasons to build on Aptos…

### Aptos Handles a Lot of Transactions Quickly

Aptos is known for being a very fast blockchain, capable of handling numerous transactions at the same time. This is possible because of a technique called parallel execution, where Aptos processes many transactions simultaneously, but only if they don't conflict with each other. This method is much faster than processing transactions one after another.

### Aptos Keeps Everything Secure With Move

Aptos uses a programming language called Move, and it’s kind of like a superhero of coding languages when it comes to safety and security. Move comes packed with features that help it automatically spot any sneaky or harmful smart contracts trying to stir up trouble. It’s like the developer can’t write bad codes, the compiler will always throw errors until every single error is fixed even the logical ones!

Another cool tool in Move’s belt is something called formal verification. This is basically using some serious math to double-check that everything a program is supposed to do is spot on, without any errors.

So, by using Move, Aptos is focusing on keeping things secure. It’s like having a really good security system in place to make sure everything runs smoothly and safely.

### Aptos Allows Easy Upgradability and On-Chain Governance

Aptos is built with a cool modular architecture, which means it’s super flexible and easy to upgrade. This setup helps users keep up with the ever-changing Web3 world more smoothly, without much hassle or downtime.

What’s more, Aptos takes upgrading to the next level with its on-chain governance system. This system lets people who hold tokens have a say in protocol upgrades through voting.

It's like having a say in how your favorite online platform evolves, which is something we’ve always wanted in Web3, right? Aptos delivers on that front, making it easier for everyone to stay up-to-date and secure.

### Aptos Provides Tons of Tools and Resources for Its Developers
