# 😺 The Ethereum Blockchain Paradigm

## Blocks 🦊

All transactions are grouped together into “blocks.” A blockchain contains a series of such blocks that are chained together.

**In Ethereum, a block consists of**:

-   a block header
-   information about the set of transactions included in that block
-   a set of other block headers for the current block’s ommers.

### Ommers explained

What the heck is an “ommer?” An ommer is a block whose parent is equal to the current block’s parent’s parent. Let’s take a quick dive into what ommers are used for and why a block contains the block headers for ommers.

Because of the way Ethereum is built, block times are much lower (~15 seconds) than those of other blockchains, like Bitcoin (~10 minutes). This enables faster transaction processing. However, one of the downsides of shorter block times is that more competing block solutions are found by miners. These competing blocks are also referred to as “orphaned blocks” (i.e. mined blocks do not make it into the main chain).

The purpose of ommers is to help reward miners for including these orphaned blocks. The ommers that miners include must be “valid,” meaning within the sixth generation or smaller of the present block. After six children, stale orphaned blocks can no longer be referenced (because including older transactions would complicate things a bit).

Ommer blocks receive a smaller reward than a full block. Nonetheless, there’s still some incentive for miners to include these orphaned blocks and reap a reward.

### Block header

Let’s get back to blocks for a moment. We mentioned previously that every block has a block “header,” but what exactly is this?

A block header is a portion of the block consisting of:

-   parentHash: a hash of the parent block’s header (this is what makes the block set a “chain”)
-   ommersHash: a hash of the current block’s list of ommers
-   beneficiary: the account address that receives the fees for mining this block
-   stateRoot: the hash of the root node of the state trie (recall how we learned that the state trie is stored in the header and makes it easy for light clients to verify anything about the state)
-   transactionsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains all transactions listed in this block
-   receiptsRoot: the hash of the root node of the trie that contains the receipts of all transactions listed in this block
-   logsBloom: a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)  (data structure) that consists of log information
-   difficulty: the difficulty level of this block
-   number: the count of current block (the genesis block has a block number of zero; the block number increases by 1 for each each subsequent block)
-   gasLimit: the current gas limit per block
-   gasUsed: the sum of the total gas used by transactions in this block
-   timestamp: the unix timestamp of this block’s inception
-   extraData: extra data related to this block
-   mixHash: a hash that, when combined with the nonce, proves that this block has carried out enough computation
-   nonce: a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that this block has carried out enough computation

Notice how every block header contains three trie structures for:

-   state (stateRoot)
-   transactions (transactionsRoot)
-   receipts (receiptsRoot)

These trie structures are nothing but the Merkle Patricia tries we discussed earlier.

Additionally, there are a few terms from the above description that are worth clarifying. Let’s take a look.

### Logs

Ethereum allows for logs to make it possible to track various transactions and messages. A contract can explicitly generate a log by defining “events” that it wants to log.

A log entry contains:

-   the logger’s account address,
-   a series of topics that represent various events carried out by this transaction, and
-   any data associated with these events.

Logs are stored in a [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), which stores the endless log data in an efficient manner.

### Transaction receipt

Logs stored in the header come from the log information contained in the transaction receipt. Just as you receive a receipt when you buy something at a store, Ethereum generates a receipt for every transaction. As you’d expect, each receipt contains certain information about the transaction. This receipt includes items like:

-   the block number
-   block hash
-   transaction hash
-   gas used by the current transaction
-   cumulative gas used in the current block after the current transaction has been executed
-   logs created when executing the current transaction
-   ..and so on

### Block difficulty

The “difficulty” of a block is used to enforce consistency in the time it takes to validate blocks. The genesis block has a difficulty of 131,072, and a special formula is used to calculate the difficulty of every block thereafter. If a certain block is validated more quickly than the previous block, the Ethereum protocol increases that block’s difficulty.

The difficulty of the block affects the nonce, which is a hash that must be calculated when mining a block, using the proof-of-work algorithm.

The relationship between the block’s difficulty and nonce is mathematically formalized as:

The only way to find a nonce that meets a difficulty threshold is to use the proof-of-work algorithm to enumerate all of the possibilities. The expected time to find a solution is proportional to the difficulty — the higher the difficulty, the harder it becomes to find the nonce, and so the harder it is to validate the block, which in turn increases the time it takes to validate a new block. So, by adjusting the difficulty of a block, the protocol can adjust how long it takes to validate a block.
