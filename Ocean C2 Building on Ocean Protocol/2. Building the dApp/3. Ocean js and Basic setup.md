# Ocean.js and Basic setup

Welcome back, ocean explorers! ðŸŒŠ Are you ready to take the plunge into the world of Ocean.js? In this lesson, we'll introduce you to this powerful JavaScript library and guide you through the basic setup. Get ready to unlock the potential of decentralized data services!

## What is Ocean.js?

Before we dive in, take a moment to consider: How do you typically interact with data in your projects? How might a decentralized approach change your workflow?

Ocean.js is a JavaScript library that enables you to privately and securely publish, exchange, and consume data. It's your toolkit for navigating the ocean of decentralized data services.

### Key Capabilities of Ocean.js:

1. **Publish** data services: Create downloadable files or set up compute-to-data services.
2. **Create** ERC721 data NFTs for each service and ERC20 datatokens for access.
3. **Sell** datatokens for a fixed price or auction off data NFTs.
4. **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens seamlessly.

## Ocean.js Architecture: A Modular Approach

Ocean.js adopts a modular architecture, making it easy to use and integrate into your projects. Let's break down its structure:

1. **Types**: Definitions for TypeScript support
2. **Config**: Configuration settings for Ocean.js
3. **Contracts**: Interfaces for interacting with smart contracts
4. **Services**: Core functionalities of Ocean Protocol
5. **Utils**: Utility functions for common tasks

This modular approach allows you to import only the components you need, keeping your code clean and efficient.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Now that we understand what Ocean.js is, let's get our hands dirty with some setup! We'll be using Node.js and nvm (Node Version Manager) to ensure a smooth development experience.

1. **Node.js & npm:** Node Js is the engine that powers your JavaScript code, even outside of a web browser. This is super important for blockchain development because it allows you to create and execute code that will interact with the Ocean network directly from your computer. npm is your trusty package manager. It's like a shopping cart for code libraries, making it easy to install and manage all the software components your project needs.
    - **Download & Install Node.js:** Head over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the installer for your operating system (macOS, or Linux). The installer will also include npm. Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you're not sure which one to choose, npm is a great starting point.
    - **Verify Success:** Open your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following commands:
        
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        
    
    You should see version numbers for both Node.js and your package manager printed out. If you do, congrats! You've successfully installed Node.js and your package manager.
    
2. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** This is our code editor of choice. It's a free, powerful tool that makes writing Solidity code (the language for smart contracts) a breeze. It's got a clean interface, tons of customization options, and a huge library of extensions to help you code like a pro.
    - **Download & Install:** Grab it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the simple installation instructions.
3. Now, let's create a new project and install Ocean.js:

```bash
mkdir my-ocean-project
cd my-ocean-project
npm init -y
npm install @oceanprotocol/lib
```

Congratulations! You've just set up your development environment and installed Ocean.js. You're now ready to start building decentralized data solutions!
