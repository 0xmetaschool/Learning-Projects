# Set up Your First Project

Alright, it's time to get our hands dirty and start building our very first Ocean Protocol project!

 In this lesson, we'll shift gears  and get everything ready to deploy our data NFT to the sepolia test network. Don't worry, we'll guide you through every step of the way, making sure it's smooth sailing!

### Prerequisites: Your Web3 Toolkit

Before we dive into the project setup, let's make sure you have a few things ready:

1. **MetaMask Wallet:**
    - If you haven't already, head over to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/) and install the extension for your browser.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new wallet or import an existing one.
    - Remember to keep your seed phrase safe and secure - it's the key to your wallet!
    - Add the Sepolia Testnet to your MetaMask. You can find instructions on how to add Sepolia to MetaMask on various online resources or within MetaMask itself.
2. **Sepolia Testnet Ether (SEP)**
    - Just like in the real world, you need some currency to interact with the blockchain. On the Sepolia testnet, we use testnet Ether (SEP).
    - Luckily, there are faucets that provide free SEP for testing purposes. Head over to the Sepolia Faucet ([https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/)) and request some SEP to be sent to your MetaMask address.
3. **Alchemy Account and RPC Endpoint**
    - We need a way to communicate with the Sepolia network. Services like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) provide RPC endpoints for this purpose
    - Sign up for a free Alchemy account, create a new app, and select the Sepolia network.
    - Copy the "HTTPS" endpoint URL from your Alchemy dashboard. We'll need this later.

### Setting the Stage: Project Initialization

With our toolkit ready, let's create the foundation for our Ocean Protocol project. Think of this as building the launchpad for our data NFT rocket!

1. **Create Your Project's Home**
    
    Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to create your project. Then, run these commands:
    
    ```jsx
    mkdir my-first-ocean-project 
    cd my-first-ocean-project
    ```
    
    This creates a cozy new directory named `my-first-ocean-project` and takes you right into it.
    
2. **Initialize with npm**
    
    Now let's tell our computer this is a Node.js project and get it ready to manage all the cool tools (dependencies) we'll be using. Run this:
    
    ```jsx
    npm init -y
    ```
    
    This sets up a `package.json` file, which is like a recipe book for your project, keeping track of all the ingredients (dependencies) it needs.
    

### Gathering the Tools: Installing Dependencies

Just like a chef needs the right ingredients, our project needs the right tools to work its magic. Let's install the necessary dependencies, including the powerful Ocean.js library.

```jsx
npm i @oceanprotocol/lib@latest dotenv crypto-js ethers@5.7.2 @truffle/hdwallet-provider
```

This command installs the core Ocean.js library along with other essential packages. These packages will help us interact with the blockchain, manage environment variables, and handle other important tasks behind the scenes.

### The `.env` File: Your Project's Control Panel

Think of the `.env` file as the control panel for your project. It's where you store important settings and secrets, keeping them organized and easily accessible.

Inside your project directory, create a new file named `.env`. We'll populate it with the following content:

```jsx
OCEAN_NETWORK=sepolia
OCEAN_NETWORK_URL="your-sepolia-rpc-url-from-alchemy" 
PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-account-private-key"

AQUARIUS_URL=https://v4.aquarius.oceanprotocol.com/
PROVIDER_URL=https://v4.provider.oceanprotocol.com
```

Remember those values you got from Alchemy and MetaMask? It's time to use them!

- Replace `"your-sepolia-rpc-url-from-alchemy"` with the actual RPC endpoint URL you copied from Alchemy. This is how your project will communicate with the Sepolia network.
- Replace `"your-metamask-account-private-key"` with the private key of the MetaMask account you'll be using. Again, **never share your private key with anyone!**

### The `config.js` File: Bridging the Gap

Now, let's create the `config.js` file. This file acts as the bridge between your project and the Ocean Protocol network. It reads the environment variables from your `.env` file and creates the necessary configuration objects for seamless interaction. Think of it as the translator that helps your project understand and communicate with the blockchain.

In your project directory, create a new file named `config.js` and paste the provided code into it. This code sets up the connection to the blockchain, initializes an Aquarius instance for metadata handling, and prepares your project to interact with Ocean smart contracts.:

```jsx
/**
* This configuration file establishes the connection between your project
* and the Ocean Protocol network. It reads environment variables from the
* '.env' file and creates the necessary configuration objects for interacting
* with Ocean smart contracts.
*/

require("dotenv").config(); // Load environment variables from .env
const {
  Aquarius,               // For interacting with the metadata store
  ConfigHelper,           // Helper to get network-specific configurations
  configHelperNetworks,   // Predefined network configurations
} = require("@oceanprotocol/lib");
const ethers = require("ethers");  // Ethereum library for blockchain interaction
const fs = require("fs");                // For file system operations
const { homedir } =  require("os");       // To get the user's home directory

/**
* Asynchronously retrieves the Ocean Protocol configuration.
*
* This function reads environment variables, sets up a provider for
* blockchain interaction, and initializes an Aquarius instance for metadata.
* It also handles special configurations for local development environments
* using Barge.
*
* @returns {Promise<Object>} An object containing the Ocean configuration.
*/
async function oceanConfig() {
  // Create a provider based on the OCEAN_NETWORK_URL environment variable
  // or fallback to a default network
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    process.env.OCEAN_NETWORK_URL || configHelperNetworks[1].nodeUri
  );

  // Create a wallet instance using the private key from the environment
  const publisherAccount = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  // Get the initial Ocean configuration based on the detected network chain ID
  let oceanConfig = new ConfigHelper().getConfig(
    parseInt(String((await publisherAccount.provider.getNetwork()).chainId))
  );

  // Initialize an Aquarius instance for metadata interaction
  const aquarius = new Aquarius(oceanConfig?.metadataCacheUri);

  // Add the publisher and consumer accounts (same in this case) and Aquarius to the configuration
  oceanConfig = {
    ...oceanConfig,
    publisherAccount: publisherAccount,
    consumerAccount: publisherAccount,
    aquarius: aquarius,
  };

  return oceanConfig;
}

// Export the oceanConfig function for use in other parts of your project
module.exports = {
  oceanConfig,
};
```

Alright! By now, your project directory should look like this:
