# Creating and Publishing a Data NFT

Alright, it's time to take our Ocean Protocol project to the next level! In this lesson, we're going to create our very first data asset and deploy it directly to the Sepolia testnet.

Think of a data asset as a digital package containing your valuable data. To make it easily accessible and tradable on the Ocean Market, we'll wrap it up in a special kind of token called a **data NFT** (Non-Fungible Token). This NFT will act as a unique representation of your data, holding all the essential information about it.

### Defining Metadata - Your NFT's Digital Identity

Before we create the NFT, let's define its metadata. Metadata is like an ID card for your NFT, providing essential details about the underlying data asset.

- **Name and Symbol**: Give your NFT a descriptive name and a short, recognizable symbol.
- **Token URI**: This is a link to a JSON file that contains more extensive information about your data asset, such as its description, author, license, and even a preview or sample.
- **Attributes**: These are additional key-value pairs that provide specific details about the data asset, such as its format, size, category, or any other relevant characteristics

## Creating the Data NFT - Bringing it to Life

Now, let's use Ocean.js to create our data NFT on the local blockchain environment provided by Barge. We'll leverage the `NftFactory` contract to handle the NFT creation process.

1. **Create a Script**
    
    In your project directory, create a new file named `create_data_nft.js`. This is where we'll write the JavaScript code to create our NFT.
    
2. **Craft the Code**
    
    Let's break down the code step-by-step so you understand what's happening:
    
    - **Import necessary modules:**
        
        ```jsx
        const { oceanConfig } = require("./config.js");
        const { ZERO_ADDRESS, NftFactory } = require("@oceanprotocol/lib");
        ```
        
        We're bringing in the `oceanConfig` from our configuration file and the `NftFactory` from the Ocean.js library. These will be our main tools for this task.
        
    - **Define the NFT creation function:**
        
        ```jsx
        const createOceanDataNFT = async () => {
          let config = await oceanConfig();
        
          // Create an instance of the NFT Factory contract
          const nftFactory = new NftFactory(
            config.nftFactoryAddress,
            config.publisherAccount
          );
        ```
        
        This function will do the heavy lifting. We start by fetching our Ocean configuration and then create an instance of the `NftFactory` contract. This instance will allow us to interact with the NFT Factory on the blockchain.
        
    - **Get the publisher's address**
        
        ```jsx
          const publisherAddress = await config.publisherAccount.getAddress();
        ```
        
        We need to know who's creating this NFT. This line gets the address of the account that will be the initial owner of the NFT.
        
    - **Set the NFT's metadata**
        
        ```jsx
          // Define the parameters for the data NFT
          const nftParams = {
            name: "My First Ocean Data NFT", 
            symbol: "MFOD", 
            templateIndex: 1,
            tokenURI: "https://example.com/my-data-nft-metadata.json", 
            transferable: true, 
            owner: publisherAddress, 
          };
        ```
        
        Here's where we define the NFT's identity. We give it a name, a symbol, and point to a `tokenURI` where we'll store more detailed information about the data asset. We also make it transferable so it can be traded on the Ocean Market.
        
    - **Create the NFT and handle the result:**
        
        ```jsx
          // Create the data NFT and get its address
          const dataNftAddress = await nftFactory.createNFT(nftParams);
          console.log(`Created Data NFT at address: ${dataNftAddress}`);
        
          return dataNftAddress;
        };
        
        // Execute the NFT creation process
        createOceanDataNFT()
          .then((nftAddress) => {
            console.log(`DataNft address ${nftAddress}`);
            process.exit();
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            console.error(err);
            process.exit(1);
          });
        ```
        
        Finally, we call the `createNFT` function to actually create the NFT on the blockchain. We then log the address of the newly created NFT and handle any potential errors during the process
        
3. **Put it all together**
    
    Now, let's combine all the code snippets into a complete script:
    
    ```jsx
    /**
     * This script creates a data NFT (non-fungible token) on the Ocean Protocol
     * using the Ocean.js library.
     *
     * Prerequisites:
     * - Ensure that the '.env' file and 'config.js' are correctly set up
     *   with your Ocean Protocol configuration.
     */
    
    const { oceanConfig } = require("./config.js");
    const { ZERO_ADDRESS, NftFactory } = require("@oceanprotocol/lib");
    
    /**
     * Creates a data NFT on the Ocean Protocol.
     *
     * @returns {Promise<string>} The Ethereum address of the newly created data NFT.
     */
    const createOceanDataNFT = async () => {
      let config = await oceanConfig();
    
      // Create an instance of the NFT Factory contract
      const nftFactory = new NftFactory(
        config.nftFactoryAddress,
        config.publisherAccount
      );
    
      const publisherAddress = await config.publisherAccount.getAddress();
    
      // Define the parameters for the data NFT
      const nftParams = {
        name: "My First Ocean Data NFT", 
        symbol: "MFOD", 
        templateIndex: 1,
        tokenURI: "https://example.com/my-data-nft-metadata.json", 
        transferable: true, 
        owner: publisherAddress, 
      };
    
      // Create the data NFT and get its address
      const dataNftAddress = await nftFactory.createNFT(nftParams);
    
      return dataNftAddress;
    };
    
    // Execute the NFT creation process
    createOceanDataNFT()
      .then((nftAddress) => {
        console.log(`DataNft address ${nftAddress}`);
        process.exit();
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
      });
    ```
    
    **4. Run the Script and Witness the Magic!**
    
    Now, let's see your code in action! Head back to your terminal, make sure you're in your project directory (`my-first-ocean-project`), and run the following command:
    
    ```jsx
    node create_data_nft.js
    ```
    
    Keep an eye on your terminal. If everything goes smoothly, you'll see a message proudly announcing the address of your newly minted data NFT. This unique address is like a digital fingerprint, identifying your NFT on the blockchain.

    You can even copy this address and view the transaction details on the Sepolia Etherscan block explorer: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
