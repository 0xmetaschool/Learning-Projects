# Why Move on Sui was Created

Let’s start by understanding Sui, the difference between Move on Sui and Move, and why Move on Sui is a game changer in the blockchain.

## Let’s recall, Sui Chain

Sui is a decentralized layer 1 blockchain which has changed the way we define asset ownership in blockchain and how the transactions are processed.

Sui introduced composable objects with Move on Sui. These objects can be single owned and shared owned. For single-owner simple transactions like transferring tokens or NFT, Sui forgoes consensus. These transactions from different users are independent of each other and hence Sui implements these transactions in a parallel manner called Parallel Transaction. Meaning, that each transaction can be processed simultaneously at a given time. This increases the scalability of Sui exponentially. Well, we will talk about this later in the course.

For shared owner objects, Sui implements a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake. To explain in simple terms, this means that when a transaction is submitted, the validators vote on whether to approve the transaction or not.

## What exactly is Move?

You must have gone through Move on Sui in the “Introduction to Sui Chain” course. But let’s just take a step back.

Before Move on Sui was built, the Move programming language existed, which we usually refer to as Core Move. Core Move is an open-source programming language that is mainly used to build and manipulate smart contracts. The Move enables common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across different blockchains. Move is also adaptable, meaning we can do multiple enhancements to it to perform different operations. And that is exactly what Move on Sui is doing. It uses the core Move and enhances it to make a Move that is compatible with Sui.

## Move on Sui

Move on Sui has some major differences from core Move or Move on other blockchains. Move on Sui benefits from the Move flexibility, and security and enhances it to the extent that it increases the throughput, reduces the delay, and makes the Move programming language more approachable and best to work with. Let’s go through some of the unique features Move on Sui has.

## Key differences in Move on Sui

Following are the key differences in Move on Sui:

1. Sui has its object-centric storage
2. Addresses in Sui represent object IDs
3. Each object in Sui has unique IDs globally
4. Sui has a module initializer (init)
5. Sui has entry points that take objects by reference as input

Let's briefly discuss these differences.

### Object-centric storage

The Sui chain has its own Sui storage instead of global storage. The global storage in core Move causes scalability issues, which the Sui chain solves by keeping the objects and modules owned by addresses on the Sui chain. All of the transactions made in the Sui chain are represented via unique identifiers, to allow the chain to run the transactions in parallel.

### Addresses in Sui represent object IDs

Well, in Move on Sui, Sui uses a 32-byte address identifier to represent the account addresses. Each transaction is signed by the account address, the sender, to access all of the information of the transaction. The account address, in Move on Sui, is stored in id: UID the compulsory field in objects.

### Object with key abilities, globally unique IDs

In Sui, using the key ability is crucial to turn a simple struct into a Sui object. The object with key ability must have an id: UID field, which stores the object’s unique address.

### Module initializer

Module initializer works like a constructor in Move on Sui. As we discussed, if you publish modules in Sui storage, the initializer helps initialize the initial values of the object’s fields. The initializer is executed at runtime, which means when you publish the module the initializer gets executed only once.

### Entry points take objects by reference as input

In Move on Sui, you can pass the objects as inputs to the public functions, which are callable by Sui transactions. There are multiple ways to do it. You can either pass them by reference, by mutable reference, or by value. Here, the objects passed by value can get deleted or can be transferred to another owner whereas you can change the data of the objects passed by mutable reference without changing the ownership or making any new instance.

In Move on Sui, you can also call entry functions, even if they are private as long as other non-entry functions have not used their inputs.

**Don’t worry!** We will discuss all of the above mentioned topics in detail in upcoming lessons.

## That’s a wrap

The Move on Sui is different and unique in many aspects. It offers many unique features that help us scale our applications. So, working with Move on Sui will help you deploy scalable unique smart contracts. I know it seems a lot! But I’ve got you and I will discuss all of the new concepts in upcoming lessons in detail. For now, let’s move forward and learn how you can set up the dev environment to run the Move on Sui programs and learn to deploy your first program on Sui.
