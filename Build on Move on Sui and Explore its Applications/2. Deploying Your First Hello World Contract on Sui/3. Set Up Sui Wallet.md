Welcome back! So you completed learning about Sui and Move programming language. Well in this lesson, you're going to learn how to set up your Sui wallet. Ready for another round of exhilarating learning? Let's dive right in!

## Setup Sui wallet

Let’s install the Sui wallet so you can deploy your contract.

You can add it easily using the browser extension. For Chrome, go to [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil) link and then add it to Chrome.

Once you add the Sui wallet extension to Chrome, you will be redirected to the new page. Sign up with your Gmail. Then you can see the “Add” option, click on it.

 After that, you will see an option of “Import passphrase”. Click on it.

Remember I asked you to save your recovery phrase of the wallet you created in the last lesson. It is time to use it here now. Paste your recovery phase and click on “Add Account”.

Currently, this is set to Mainnet, you can hover over the settings icon in the top right corner. Go to Network and change to the desired network. We are changing to the Devnet network as we deployed our contract to the Devnet network.

## Get some fake tokens

You can request the SUI tokens just by clicking on the “Request Devnet SUI Tokens” button.

- **Note**: If you need SUI tokens for other networks like Testnet, just change the network and request tokens.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you learned about setting up a Sui wallet and how to get a few coins on your network. Next, we will dive into understanding the architecture of the Move on Sui package that we created in this section. We will also explore what the basic smart contract structure looks like in Move on Sui in the next section. So keep your momentum going.
