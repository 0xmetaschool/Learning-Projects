# Deploy Your First Sui Contract

Great work on setting up your development environment for Move on Sui. In this lesson, we will learn to run and deploy a “Hello World” smart contract on the Sui blockchain and explore it in the Explorer.

## Deploy your first Sui contract

Open your favorite terminal because we will be running a few commands to achieve our goal.

The first step is to initialize a workspace environment. This will contain the basic files for running any Move file. You can create the workspace using the following command; I have named mine `hello_world`:

```
sui move new hello_world
```

The command will generate a folder named `hello_world` and it will contain a file `Move.toml` and a folder `sources`:

- P.S.: I am using Visual Studio IDE as it visualizes the structure of my workspace better.

Navigate to the `sources/` directory. Create a new Move file. I am naming it `Hello.move`.

Paste the following code in the `Hello.move` you just created:

```
// Copyright (c) 2022, Sui Foundation
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

/// A basic Hello World example for Sui Move, part of the Sui Move intro course:
/// https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course
/// 
module hello_world::hello_world {

    use std::string;
    use sui::object::{Self, UID};
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    /// An object that contains an arbitrary string
    struct HelloWorldObject has key, store {
        id: UID,
        /// A string contained in the object
        text: string::String
    }

    public entry fun mint(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let object = HelloWorldObject {
            id: object::new(ctx),
            text: string::utf8(b"Hello World!")
        };
        transfer::public_transfer(object, tx_context::sender(ctx));
    }

}
```

- **Note:** This lesson just focuses on running our “Hello World” program on Sui. We will talk about the file details and explanations in the upcoming lessons. So don’t worry–we have got it for you!

## Build and publish on Sui

Now let’s build our Move file using the following command:

```
sui move build
```

This will generate an output like the following:

![deploy-3.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-3.webp?raw=true)

After running the command, your project directory will include a `build` folder and a `Move.lock` file.

![deploy-4.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-4.webp?raw=true)

### Create your Sui account

Now let’s run the following command to create your Sui account:

```
sui client new-address ed25519
```

It will generate the output something like this:

![deploy-5.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-5.webp?raw=true)

- **Important**: Save the recovery phrase, we will need it in the next lesson to set up our wallet.

Replace `[YOUR_ADDRESS]` in the command below with your address and run it.

```
sui client switch --address [YOUR_ADDRESS]
```

You can also view which is the current active address using the `sui client active-address` command:

![deploy-6.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-6.webp?raw=true)

Lastly, head over to the [Sui Devnet faucet discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) and paste “!faucet [YOUR_ADDRESS]” to receive 10 SUI tokens.

### Set up the dev env

To deploy on Sui Devnet, please execute the following commands.

```
sui client new-env --alias devnet --rpc https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env devnet
```

### Publish the contract

First, copy the absolute path of your `Hello.move` file:

![deploy-7.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-7.webp?raw=true)

Replace `[YOUR_PATH]` with the absolute path of your file and run the following command:

```
sui client publish --gas-budget 10000000 [YOUR_PATH]
```

We will have a long output but scroll to the start of the output and copy the Transaction Digest:

![deploy-8.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-8.webp?raw=true)

Head over to [https://suiexplorer.com/?network=devnet](https://suiexplorer.com/?network=devnet). Paste the Transaction Digest in the search bar to find your transaction on the Sui Explorer:

![deploy-9.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_sui_c2/Deploy%20Your%20First%20Sui%20Contract/deploy-9.webp?raw=true)

Whoo! You did great! We have deployed our first “Hello World” program on Sui 🎉

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, this lesson introduced the process of running smart contracts on Sui. We learned how to create a Move workspace, build and publish Move files, create a Sui account, and deploy a contract on the Sui devnet. Congratulations on completing this lesson!
