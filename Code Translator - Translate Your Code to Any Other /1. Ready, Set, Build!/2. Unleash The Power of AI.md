# Unleash The Power of AI

Get OpenAI API credentials and write your first coding example in NodeJS using the OpenAI API.

## AI, OpenAI, and GPT models

AI involves machines simulating human intelligence, while machine learning focuses on teaching machines to learn and improve without explicit programming. OpenAI is a tech lab that creates safe and advanced AI models, including ChatGPT. The OpenAI API is a tool that allows developers to use OpenAI's latest AI models and train their own models.

GPT models are generative language models developed by OpenAI that can generate their own text based on large amounts of data. GPT-3 is the largest language model with 175 billion parameters, while GPT-3.5 is smaller and faster to train for specific tasks. GPT-4 is the latest addition and rumored to have up to 10 trillion parameters with even better language generation capabilities than GPT-3. An API key is required to access OpenAI API, which will be used to write NodeJS programs.

Before writing our first program using NodeJS and OpenAI API, let's quickly go over what an API key is and how can you generate it to access OpenAI API.

## What is the big deal about API key

An API key is a unique identifier that allows you to access an API. OpenAI is an AI research lab that provides powerful APIs for developers to use in their applications. In order to use OpenAI APIs, you need to generate an API key.

API Key is the combination of different random characters. Here’s an example of how API key looks like:

```
sk-HDGynLoklZNDSDmVSynMT8dlbkFjQnSIG5RRUzA0CeU7XPKC
```

## Steps to generate an API key

Now, to get started:

1. You gotta create an account on the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) website.
2. Click on your profile and then click on Manage account then click on Billing.
3. Upgrade to a paid account. It's just a dollar a day, You can cancel whenever you want (Individual paid account).

## Quickstart OpenAI API

Let’s experiment will all the knowledge we have gained so far! Let’s write a simple NodeJS program that will use OpenAI API to generate some text.

### Create NodeJS app

Here are the steps to create a NodeJS app:

1. First of all, install NodeJs in your system. Head over to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the instructions to install it.
2. Head over to your terminal and create a new directory for your NodeJs app:

```
mkdir my-app
```

1. Move to the new directory:

```
cd my-app
```

1. Initialize a new NodeJs project and accept the default options:

```
npm init -y
```

1. Install the **`axios`** package as a dependency:

```
npm install axios
```

1. Install the **`dotenv`** package as a dependency:

```
npm install dotenv
```

1. Create a new file called **`app.js`** in your project directory:

```
touch app.js
```

1. Create a new file called **`.env`** in your project directory. We will use this file to keep our API key:

```
touch .env
```

Let’s look at this step happening visually:

![npm init.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/code-translator-course/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20/1.%20Ready%2C%20Set%2C%20Build!/Unleash%20The%20Power%20of%20AI%20b96192c35b834fffad56fc78b86efe8c/npm_init.gif)

### File structure

After running the commands, the file structure will look like this:

![Untitled](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/code-translator-course/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20/1.%20Ready%2C%20Set%2C%20Build!/Unleash%20The%20Power%20of%20AI%20b96192c35b834fffad56fc78b86efe8c/Untitled.png)

Now, let’s move on to the coding part.

### Code

First of all, fill your **`.env`** file with your API key that you generated earlier. Use this format to do this: 

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE
```

Now, let’s write a simple NodeJS code that will take prompt and generate the response using GPT-3.5 model. Paste this code to the **`app.js`** file.

```
// Import the Axios library to make requests to the OpenAI API
const axios = require('axios');
// Load the OpenAI API key from a file named ".env"
require('dotenv').config();
// Store the OpenAI API key in a variable for later use
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

// Create a new "client" to interact with the OpenAI API
// and include the API key in the request headers for authentication
const client = axios.create({
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Use the API key to authenticate the request
  }
});

// Define the text prompt and the desired length and randomness of the generated text
const data = {
  // The model name
  model: 'gpt-4',
  // The input for the model (for chat models, this should be a list of messages)
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Once upon a time' }],
  // The maximum length of the generated text in tokens
  max_tokens: 10,
  // The degree of randomness in the generated text (higher values mean more random output)
  temperature: 0.5
};

// Send a request to the OpenAI API to generate text based on the provided data
client.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', data)
  // If the request is successful, print the generated text to the console
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);
  })
  // If there is an error with the request, print the error message to the console
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
  });

```

### Code explanation

Let’s break down the code line-by-line and understand what is happening here.

```
// Import the Axios library to make requests to the OpenAI API
const axios = require('axios');
```

- This line imports a library called Axios, which is used to make HTTP requests (which are a way of sending and receiving data over the internet) to the OpenAI API.

```
// Load the OpenAI API key from a file named ".env"
require('dotenv').config();
```

- This line loads a file called **`.env`**, which should contain sensitive information (like the API key for OpenAI) that we don't want to put directly in our code.
    - The **`dotenv`** library helps us load this information from the file.

```
// Store the OpenAI API key in a variable for later use
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

- This line retrieves the API key we loaded from the **`.env`** file and stores it in a variable called **`apiKey`**. We'll use this key later to authenticate our requests to the OpenAI API.

```
// Create a new "client" to interact with the OpenAI API
// and include the API key in the request headers for authentication
const client = axios.create({
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` // Use the API key to authenticate the request
  }
});
```

- This block of code creates a new **`client`** that we'll use to interact with the OpenAI API.
    - We configure the client to include the API key in the request headers (which are like metadata about the request) so that the OpenAI API knows that we're authorized to use their service.

```
// Define the text prompt and the desired length and randomness of the generated text
const data = {
  // The model name;
  model: 'gpt-4',
  // The input for the model (for chat models, this should be a list of messages)
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Once upon a time' }],
  // The maximum length of the generated text in tokens
  max_tokens: 10,
  // The degree of randomness in the generated text (higher values mean more random output)
  temperature: 0.5
};
```

- This block of code sets up some configuration for the text generation process.
    - **`prompt`**: Define the starting sentence (**`Once upon a time`**).
    - **`max_tokens`**: Sets the maximum length of the generated text (10 words or punctuation marks).
    - **`temperature`**: Sets the degree of randomness in the output (0.5, which is medium-high).

```
// Send a request to the OpenAI API to generate text based on the provided data
client.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', data)
```

- This line sends a POST request to the OpenAI API, which tells the API that we want to generate some text.
    - The URL we're sending the request to is **`https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions`**, which is the endpoint (a specific location on the API server) that we use to generate text.
    - We also pass in the **`data`** object that we defined earlier, which contains the starting sentence and other configuration options for the text generation process.

```
  // If the request is successful, print the generated text to the console
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);
  })
```

- If the request to the OpenAI API is successful (i.e. we get a response back from the API), this block of code executes.
    - Specifically, we print the generated text to the console.
    - The **`response`** object that we get back from the API contains a **`data`** property, which contains an array of potential

### Output

Now, we’re done with the explanation. Let’s try running our NodeJS app. Use the following command to run your project (Please make sure you are in your project directory):

```
node app.js
```

Let’s look at what I got after running the code. PS: You might get different answer because each time we run the model it generates different answer.

![run nodejs app.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/raw/code-translator-course/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20/1.%20Ready%2C%20Set%2C%20Build!/Unleash%20The%20Power%20of%20AI%20b96192c35b834fffad56fc78b86efe8c/run_nodejs_app.gif)

> **Note:** This code is using the super powerful **`Davinci`** model from the OpenAI API, which is famous for generating some seriously impressive text. However, it's important to use the API in a responsible and ethical way, and be mindful of the model's limitations to avoid any misuse.
> 

## So let’s wrap up?

As we dive deeper into OpenAI's GPT models, let's keep in mind the responsibility that comes with this kind of power. We have the opportunity to create some truly amazing things, but we need to do it in a way that's ethical and responsible.
