# Whatâ€™s Up

Hi fam, Welcome to Metaschool. Today we are here with another exciting course!

So what are we building today? Today we're going to build our very own AI bot using the latest and greatest technology - the GPT-3.5 model. And not just any bot, we're talking about a bot thatâ€™s going to auto translate your code to any programming language of your choice! Not just this, you can give a description of the code you want to generate, in Urdu or English, and it will generate the code for you in any programming language you choose.

This project is important, because it will give you basic understanding of how to build AI based project using the latest APIs of OpenAI. Cool, right?!

Let me give you a sneak peek of the one and only Code Translator that you're ever going to want to build!

But don't take my word for it, you gotta try it out for yourself. We've got a live code translator onÂ [this website](https://jatin0.netlify.app/), that's already causing a stir. People can't get enough of it! So, before you even start this course, go check it out and see what all the fuss is about.

So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's do this!

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Cover some super cool basic understanding of AI, OpenAI, and GPT models
2. We will set up the development environment with OpenAI, NodeJS, and NextJS
3. We will write text completion models in NodeJS using amazing openAI GPT-3.5 model
4. We will build a responsive front-end app in NextJS and back-end that uses OpenAI API and interacts with front-end, then we will run it

## Prerequisites

Learning new tech is always easier when you have some prior knowledge. So, before diving into OpenAI and AI model development, we recommend brushing up on the following:

1. Programming knowledge: Youâ€™ll need basic programming knowledge to start experimenting with advanced languages. Knowledge of Javascript programming language is a plus.
2. Critical thinking: To wrap your head around the complex and abstract concepts in OpenAI and AI, you'll need some solid critical thinking skills.

But don't sweat it, â€“ you can still learn OpenAI API and AI model development without knowing everything in advance. It's just gonna be way smoother if you got some background knowledge under your belt.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with us, you will be getting XPs and a special NFT which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is what the NFT looks like.
