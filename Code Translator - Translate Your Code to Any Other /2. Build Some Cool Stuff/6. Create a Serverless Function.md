# Create a Serverless Function

Now we will create a serverless function that takes in some input parameters, sends them to OpenAI's API, and returns a response. This serverless function will help us making a request and receiving a response from OpenAI API.

## General usecase

The serverless function will be used to create a language processing tool that can perform tasks like translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering. It will work by taking input parameters such as the language of the input, the language of the output, and the code to be processed. These parameters are sent to OpenAI's API, which processes the information and returns a response.

### Example

For example, if you wanted to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, you would pass in the English sentence as the **`inputCode`**, specify the **`inputLanguage`** as English, and the **`outputLanguage`** as Spanish. The code would then send this information to OpenAI's API, which would perform the translation and return the Spanish translation.

### Usage

The serverless function can be used as a starting point for building customized language processing applications to suit various needs. By using this code, developers can build tools that perform specific tasks based on the input parameters provided. The code also catches errors, so if anything goes wrong, the function will return an error message.

Letâ€™s dive into creating and building the serverless function.

## Create file

Create a file called **`translate.js`** under the **`pages/api`** folder and delete the existing files in this folder. We will use this file to write our code for serverless function. Hereâ€™s the file structure:

## Code summary

Here's what the code will do in simpler terms:

- This code will be an example of a serverless function that takes in some input parameters, sends them to OpenAI's API, and returns a response.
- First, it will import a function called **`OpenAIStream`** from a utility file located in the **`@/utils`** directory.
- Then, it will define a constant called **`config`** which will contain a single property called **`runtime`** set to the string value **`'edge'`**.
- After that, the code will define an **`async`** function called **`handler`** that will take two parameters, **`req`** and **`res`**, which stand for "request" and "response," respectively. This function will be the main entry point for the serverless function.
- Within the **`handler`** function, it will wait for the incoming request data to be parsed as JSON, and destructures the resulting object into three variables:
  - **`inputLanguage`**,
  - **`outputLanguage`**, and
  - **`inputCode`**.
- Next, it will call the **`OpenAIStream`** function with the input parameters and wait for a response to be returned.
- Finally, it will return a new **`Response`** object containing the **`stream`** response from the **`OpenAIStream`** function.
- If any errors occur during this process, the code will catch them and send a **`500`** status code with the error message **`"Error"`** in the response body.

## Code explanation

Let's go through the code step-by-step to see how it works.

```
import { OpenAIStream } from '@/utils';
```

- **`import`** is a keyword that allows us to access functions and objects from other files
- **`{ OpenAIStream }`** specifies the name of the function we want to import from the **`'@/utils'`** file
- **`'@/utils'`** is a file path that specifies where the **`'OpenAIStream'`** function can be found

```
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};
```

- **`export`** is a keyword that allows us to make the **`config`** object available to other files
- **`config`** is an object that specifies configuration options for the serverless function
- **`runtime: 'edge'`** specifies that the function should be executed using the Cloudflare Workers "edge" runtime

```
export default async function handler(req, res) {
```

- **`export default`** is a keyword that allows us to make the **`handler`** function available to other files
- **`async function`** is a function that can use **`await`** to wait for asynchronous operations to complete
- **`handler`** is the name of the function that will handle incoming requests to the serverless function
- **`(req, res)`** are the parameters that the **`handler`** function will take in
  - **`req`** stands for request and contains information about the incoming request
  - **`res`** stands for response and contains methods to send a response back to the client

```
  try {
    const { inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode } = await req.json();
```

- **`try`** is a keyword that starts a block of code that may throw an error
- **`const`** is a keyword that creates a constant variable that cannot be changed
- **`{ inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode }`** is an object destructuring syntax that extracts three properties from the JSON data that is sent in the request body
- **`await req.json()`** is an asynchronous operation that waits for the request body to be parsed as JSON

```
    const stream = await OpenAIStream(
      inputLanguage,
      outputLanguage,
      inputCode
    );
```

- **`const stream`** creates a constant variable called **`stream`**
- **`await OpenAIStream(...)`** is an asynchronous operation that waits for the **`OpenAIStream`** function to return a response
- **`(...)`** is a syntax that passes in the three variables (**`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`**) as parameters to the **`OpenAIStream`** function

```
    return new Response(stream);
```

- **`return`** is a keyword that specifies what the function should return when it is called
- **`new Response(stream)`** creates a new HTTP response object with the contents of the **`stream`** variable

```
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error')
  }
```

- **`catch`** is a keyword that specifies what the function should do if an error is thrown in the **`try`** block
- **`error`** is the name of the variable that will contain the error message
- **`res.status(500)`** sets the status code of the HTTP response to **`500`** (Internal Server Error)
- **`res.send('Error')`** sends the string **`'Error'`** as the response body

## Complete code

The following is the complete code. Go ahead copy and paste the following code in **`translate.js`** file under the **`pages/api`** folder.

```
// Import the OpenAIStream function from the '@/utils' file
import { OpenAIStream } from '@/utils';

// Define the configuration for the serverless function
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

// Define the main function for the serverless function
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Parse incoming request data as JSON
    const { inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode } = await req.json();

    // Call the OpenAIStream function with input parameters
    const stream = await OpenAIStream(
      inputLanguage,
      outputLanguage,
      inputCode
    );

    // Return the response from the OpenAIStream function
    return new Response(stream);
  } catch (error) {
    // Catch errors and return an error message
    res.status(500).send('Error')
  }
}
```
