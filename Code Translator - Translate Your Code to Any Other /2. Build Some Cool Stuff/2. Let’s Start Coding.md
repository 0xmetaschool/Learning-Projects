# Let’s Start Coding

Let’s dive into building the first component of our application i.e., **`CodeEditor.js`**.

## Why code editor

The first step to building this application is to provide a space where the user can edit their code. Editing includes adding, removing, or copying the content. To enable this functionality, we will build a code edit in this lesson.

## Code editor

CodeEditor will render a CodeMirror editor for writing code. CodeMirror is an open-source code editor library for web applications. It supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and search and replace features for many programming languages and file formats. It can be used as a React component to provide an in-browser code editor in a React application. 

CodeEditor imports required modules such as CodeMirror and React, defines a state for a "copyText" button that allows the user to copy the code, and sets configuration options for the CodeMirror editor such as language mode, auto indentation, and smart indentation. It then renders the CodeMirror editor with an extensions property that initializes the editor with Go programming language support. The component also includes a button to copy the code and change the state of the "copyText" button to "Copied!". The component is then exported as the default export.

The copy option will work like this in our app:

> **Don’t Worry!** We will see this happening live in upcoming lessons.

### Create file

Create the **`components`** folder and create a **`CodeEditor.js`** file in the **`components`** folder. This file will contain the code for our code editor, which we will discuss in this lesson.

## Code summary

Here's what the code will do in simpler terms:

- The code will import several modules required for the CodeEditor component.
- The CodeEditor component will be defined to include a CodeMirror editor with several configuration options.
- The initial value of the copyText state will be set to 'Copy', and then it will be reset to 'Copy' after 2 seconds using the useEffect hook.
- The component will include a copy button that copies the code to the clipboard and update the copyText state to 'Copied!' when clicked.
- The CodeMirror editor will be initialized with Go programming language support.
- Finally, the CodeEditor component will be exported as the default export.

## Code explanation

The **`CodeEditor`** component uses the **`CodeMirror`** library to provide a code editor with options such as language mode, indentation settings, and key bindings. The component allows the user to edit code and provides a button to copy the code to the clipboard. When the user clicks the button, the code is copied and the button text is changed to "Copied!". After 2 seconds, the button text changes back to "Copy".

The component takes four props: 

- **`code`** (the initial value of the editor),
- **`editable`** (a boolean indicating whether the editor is editable or not),
- **`setCode`** (a function to set the value of the code), and
- **`language`** (the programming language mode of the editor).

The component initializes the editor with support for the Go programming language.

Let's go through the code line by line and explain what it does:

```
import { StreamLanguage } from '@codemirror/language';
import { go } from '@codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/go';
import CodeMirror from '@uiw/react-codemirror';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { eclipse } from "@uiw/codemirror-theme-eclipse";
```

- These lines import required libraries for the code editor component. **`@codemirror/language`** and **`@codemirror/legacy-modes/mode/go`** are used for syntax highlighting and formatting of code written in Go language. **`@uiw/react-codemirror`** is the code editor component that we'll use, while **`react`** is a library for building user interfaces, and **`@uiw/codemirror-theme-eclipse`** provides an eclipse-like theme for the code editor.

```
const CodeEditor = ({ code = '', editable = false, setCode, language }) => {
```

- This is a functional component called **`CodeEditor`** that takes four props:
    - **`code`**: A string of code to display in the editor (default is an empty string).
    - **`editable`**: A boolean to determine whether the code in the editor is editable or not (default is **`false`**).
    - **`setCode`**: A function to update the **`code`** prop whenever the user changes the code in the editor.
    - **`language`**: A string indicating which programming language the code is written in (this will be used for syntax highlighting).

```
  const [copyText, setCopyText] = useState('Copy');
```

- This creates a state variable called **`copyText`** with an initial value of **`'Copy'`**. We'll use this variable to keep track of whether the user has copied the code from the editor or not.

```
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setCopyText('Copy');
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [copyText]);
```

- This effect hook sets a timeout to change the **`copyText`** variable back to **`'Copy'`** after 2 seconds. It will run whenever the **`copyText`** variable changes.

```
  const config = {
    lineNumbers: true,
    mode: language,
    indentUnit: 4,
    smartIndent: true,
    indentWithTabs: false,
    electricChars: true,
    autoCloseBrackets: true,
    matchBrackets: true,
    extraKeys: { 'Ctrl-Space': 'autocomplete' },
    // theme: eclipse,
    indent: {
      auto: true,
    },
  };
```

- This creates a configuration object called **`config`** that we'll pass to the **`CodeMirror`** component later. It contains various options for the code editor, including:
    - **`lineNumbers`**: A boolean indicating whether to show line numbers.
    - **`mode`**: The programming language syntax highlighting mode.
    - **`indentUnit`**: The number of spaces to use for indentation.
    - **`smartIndent`**: A boolean indicating whether to use smart indentation.
    - **`indentWithTabs`**: A boolean indicating whether to use tabs for indentation.
    - **`electricChars`**: A boolean indicating whether to use "electric characters" to automatically indent code.
    - **`autoCloseBrackets`**: A boolean indicating whether to automatically close brackets.
    - **`matchBrackets`**: A boolean indicating whether to highlight matching brackets.
    - **`extraKeys`**: An object with key-value pairs of extra keyboard shortcuts to add to the editor.
    - **`indent`**: An object with options related to indentation, including an **`auto`** property that automatically indents code.

  // Resetting the copyText state to 'Copy' after 2 seconds
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setCopyText('Copy');
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [copyText]);

  // Configuration options for CodeMirror component
  const config = {
    lineNumbers: true,

      auto: true,
    },
  };

  // Rendering the CodeEditor component
  return (
    <div className="relative border-2 border-t-0 border-black rounded-b-lg">
      {/* Copy button */}
      <button
        className="absolute right-1 top-1 z-10 rounded bg-[#C53AAE] p-1 text-xs text-white hover:bg-[#2D2E3A] active:bg-[#2D2E3A] "
        onClick={() => {
          navigator.clipboard.writeText(code);
          setCopyText('Copied!');
        }}
      >
        {copyText}
      </button>

      {/* CodeMirror editor */}
      <CodeMirror
          editable={editable}
          value={code}
          minHeight="300px"
          maxHeight="300px"
          extensions={[StreamLanguage.define(go)]} // Initializing the CodeMirror editor with Go programming language support
          config={config}
          onChange={(value) => setCode(value)}
          className="rounded-b-xl"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

// Exporting the CodeEditor component as the default export
export default CodeEditor;
```

We are done with adding our first code component, Cheers!!! Let’s move on to the next component of the code in the next lesson. Happy and dope learning!!!
