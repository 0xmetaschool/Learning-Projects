# Letâ€™s Try Our Code Translator

So we are in the final lesson, keep the excitement high because we are just few steps away from having our very own AI bot which can translate the code.

## Letâ€™s ignite our app

Run the following command in your terminal to kickstart you code translator.

```
npm run dev
```

Letâ€™s look at how the output will look like after running this command.

Now, head over to the **`http://localhost:3000`** and start experimenting with the code translator. The code translator UI will look like this:

## Run examples

Letâ€™s try running different examples in our code translator and check if the output is good.

### Example # 1

Letâ€™s first of all try generating the code using natural language. Ask the code translator to write a complete linked list code in Python.

### Example # 2

Letâ€™s use the Python linked list code and convert it into Javascript.

### Example # 3

Now letâ€™s convert the Javascript code to GoLang.
