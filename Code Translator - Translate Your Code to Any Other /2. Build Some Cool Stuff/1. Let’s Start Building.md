# Let’s Start Building

Now, let’s dive into the cool world of the code translator Project. This project is all about creating an AI bot that can convert your code to any other programming language. It's going to be an awesome journey!

## Key features of code translator

Check out some of the key features of the code translator:

- Converting the natural language to any programming language.
    - Example input: Add 2+3
    - Example output in Python: **`sum = 2 + 3`**
- Converting the code from one programming language to another.
    - Example input in Python: **`var = 1`**
    - Example output in GoLang: **`var := 1`**
- Responsive user experience for anyone to convert their codes in an instant.

## Let's get it started

We’ll be using code and prompts to build our code translator. We will train our model using prompts that will help us generate accurate codes that are prone to no errors.

To build the project, we’ll use NextJS and OpenAI engine. By setting up our development environment and using an OpenAI API key we have already generated.

**Don’t Worry**! We will explain everything one-by-one. So, let’s buckle up to learn and build!

First things first! Let’s setup our development environment.

## Setup your development environment

We have already created a basic NextJS app for your ease. You just need to clone the app from GitHub and install dependencies. Let’s learn how you can do this.

### Install GitHub desktop

Head over to the [GitHub desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/). Download and install GitHub desktop for your specific system.

### Connect your GitHub account with Github desktop

After installing the GitHub desktop, you’ll need to connect your GitHub account with GitHub desktop. Authorise your GitHub account and get started!

### Clone NextJS app

1. Go to your GitHub desktop app
2. Click on **Add.** You will see some option like these:

1. Click on **Clone Repository…**
2. Go to **URL** and paste this URL to clone the app: https://github.com/0xmetaschool/code-translator-boilerplate.git
3. Choose empty folder where you want to clone the application.

1. After cloning the app open the app in your favourite IDE. We recommend using Visual Studio Code.

### Install dependencies

Next, we need to install the packages those are in **`package.json`** file. Use the following command to do this:

```
npm install
```

Let’s look at the output of this command.

## File structure

After cloning the application your file structure will look like this: 

![Untitled](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20/2.%20Build%20Some%20Cool%20Stuff/Let%E2%80%99s%20Start%20Building%207d8da3159b6447bbb1f06990d80a494b/Untitled%202.webp?raw=true)

> **Note:** This is a basic NextJS app that has default code. We will change the file structure and existing code as per need in upcoming lessons.
> 

We have added **`background.jpg`** and **`twitter.jpg`** images in **`public`** folder those you will use to build the front-end of your project in upcoming lessons.

## Run the application

You can run the application using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Let’s look at the output of this command.

![npm run dev.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Code%20Translator%20-%20Translate%20Your%20Code%20to%20Any%20Other%20/2.%20Build%20Some%20Cool%20Stuff/Let%E2%80%99s%20Start%20Building%207d8da3159b6447bbb1f06990d80a494b/npm_run_dev.webp?raw=true)

Head over to **`http://localhost:3000`** . You will see the basic NextJS app. 

> **Note:** We have removed the images from the app, so you won’t see them.

Well done on cloning the app! Let’s move to the next lesson and start coding our code translator application.
