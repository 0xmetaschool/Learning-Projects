# Prompt Engineering

So far we worked on the front-end of our application. Now we need to work on the back-end of our application. For back-end, we need to interact with OpenAI API and train our model using prompt engineering so that it can generate the code and also convert the code to different programming languages.

## Generate natural language responses

In order to make the back-end of our application, we will define a function called **`OpenAIStream`** that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate natural language responses based on input prompts. The function takes three parameters: **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`**.

It sends a POST request to the OpenAI API with the prompt and some other options and receives a response that is a readable stream. The response is then parsed line by line using the **`eventsource-parser`** library and converted to text using **`TextEncoder`** and **`TextDecoder`**.

Finally, the parsed text is returned as a readable stream for further processing.

### Create folder and file

Create a folder named **`utils`** and under it create a file named **`index.js`**.

## Code summary

Here's what the code will do in simpler terms:

- A function named **`createPrompt`** will be defined that takes **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`** as input parameters and creates a prompt message based on those parameters.
- A function named **`OpenAIStream`** will be exported that will send a POST request to the OpenAI GPT-3 API with the prompt message and return the response as a stream.
- Inside **`OpenAIStream`**, **`createPrompt`** will be called to create a prompt message.
- A system message will be defined as an object with a role and content.
- A fetch request will be sent to the OpenAI GPT-3 API with the system message and stream parameters, including the GPT-3 model, system message, temperature, and stream.
- The response of the fetch request will be returned as a stream.

## Code explanation

This code appears to be a JavaScript module that exports a function called **`OpenAIStream`**. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the code:

```
import endent from 'endent';
import { createParser } from 'eventsource-parser';
```

- **`import`** statements are used to import functions or modules from external files.
- In this code, the **`endent`** and **`createParser`** functions are being imported from two different modules: **`endent`** and **`eventsource-parser`**.

```
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

- `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` will read the API key that we will define in our `.env` file later on.
- `apiKey` is a variable which we will use later on for authorization.

```
const createPrompt = (inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode) => {

```

- **`createPrompt`** is a function that takes in three parameters: **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`**.
- The **`=>`** syntax indicates that this function is an arrow function.
- The prompt is constructed based on the input parameters, and includes examples of how to translate code between different languages.

```
if (inputLanguage === 'Natural Language') {

```

- This is the beginning of an **`if`** statement that checks if the **`inputLanguage`** parameter is equal to the string **`'Natural Language'`**.

```
return endent`
    You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the natural language to "${outputLanguage}" code. Do not include \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`.

    Example translating from natural language to JavaScript:

    Natural language:
    Print the numbers 0 to 9.

    JavaScript code:
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }

    Natural language:
    ${inputCode}

    ${outputLanguage} code (no \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`):
    `;

```

- If the **`inputLanguage`** is equal to **`'Natural Language'`**, this block of code is executed.
- The **`endent`** function is used to format the string returned by this function, which allows for multi-line strings with indentation.
- The returned string provides instructions for the user to translate natural language to the **`outputLanguage`** code.
- It includes an example of translating natural language to JavaScript.
- It also includes the **`inputCode`** parameter and prompts the user to provide the **`outputLanguage`** code.

```
} else if (outputLanguage === 'Natural Language') {

```

- This **`else if`** block is executed if the **`outputLanguage`** parameter is equal to **`'Natural Language'`**.

```
return endent`
      You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the "${inputLanguage}" code to natural language in plain English that the average adult could understand. Respond as bullet points starting with -.

      Example translating from JavaScript to natural language:

      JavaScript code:
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }

      Natural language:
      Print the numbers 0 to 9.

      ${inputLanguage} code:
      ${inputCode}

      Natural language:
     `;

```

- The returned string in this block of code prompts the user to translate **`inputLanguage`** code to natural language that the average adult could understand.
- It includes an example of translating JavaScript code to natural language.
- It also includes the **`inputCode`** parameter and prompts the user to provide the natural language translation.

```
} else {

```

- This **`else`** block is executed if none of the previous conditions were met.

```
return endent`
      You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the "${inputLanguage}" code to "${outputLanguage}" code. Do not include \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`.

      Example translating from JavaScript to Python:

      JavaScript code:
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }

      Python code:
      for i in range(10):
        print(i)

      ${inputLanguage} code:
      ${inputCode}

      ${outputLanguage} code (no \\\\`\\\\`\\\\`):
     `;

```

- The returned string in this block of code prompts the user to translate **`inputLanguage`** code to **`outputLanguage`** code.
- It includes an example of translating JavaScript code to Python.
- It also includes the **`inputCode`** parameter and prompts the user to provide the output.

```
export const OpenAIStream = async (inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode) => {
  const prompt = createPrompt(inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode);

  const system = { role: 'system', content: prompt };

  const res = await fetch(`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer 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`,
    },
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      messages: [system],
      temperature: 0,
      stream: true,
    }),
  });
```

- Overall, this code calls the OpenAI API to translate code between programming languages based on the **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`** parameters that are passed into the **`OpenAIStream()`** function.
  - **`export const OpenAIStream = async (inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode) => {`**: This line defines a named export of a function called **`OpenAIStream`**, which is an asynchronous function that takes three parameters - **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`**.
  - **`const prompt = createPrompt(inputLanguage, outputLanguage, inputCode);`**: This line declares a constant variable called **`prompt`** which is assigned the result of calling the **`createPrompt()`** function with the **`inputLanguage`**, **`outputLanguage`**, and **`inputCode`** arguments.
  - **`const system = { role: 'system', content: prompt };`**: This line declares a constant variable called **`system`** which is assigned an object with two properties - **`role`** and **`content`**.
    - The **`role`** property is set to the string **`'system'`**.
    - The **`content`** property is set to the value of the **`prompt`** variable.
  ```
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      },
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages: [system],
        temperature: 0,
        stream: true,
      }),
    });
  ```
  - This line makes an asynchronous call to the OpenAI API using the **`fetch()`** method. It sends a POST request to the API endpoint with a JSON object that contains a **`model`**, **`messages`**, **`temperature`**, and **`stream`** property. The **`messages`** property is an array containing the **`system`** object that was defined earlier. The **`Authorization`** header is included in the request, which contains an API key required to access the OpenAI API. The response from the API is stored in the **`res`** variable using the **`await`** keyword, which waits for the response to be received before continuing execution.

```
Now create a file named `.env` in the main folder. Add the following in your file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=ADD_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Wohooo! The code is for the prompt engineering is done. We can now ask our AI code to write code by giving them instruction in natural language 🎉!
