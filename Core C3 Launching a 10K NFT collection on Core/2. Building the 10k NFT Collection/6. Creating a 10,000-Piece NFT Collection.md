## Creating Your Digital Masterpieces: Images and Metadata

**Remember**, an NFT isn't just a pretty picture—it's a powerful fusion of art and technology. Each NFT is composed of two essential elements:

- **The Image**: This is the visual masterpiece that will captivate your audience and make your collection stand out. It's the artwork itself, whether it's a pixelated character bursting with personality, a meticulously hand-drawn illustration, a mind-bending 3D animation, or any other visual creation that you dream up. Think of it as the cover of your NFT's "book."
- **The Metadata**: This is where the magic happens—behind the scenes. Metadata is like your NFT's digital DNA, containing all the essential information that makes it unique and verifiable on the blockchain. This includes the NFT's name, a captivating description, a list of attributes that define its traits and rarity (think "laser eyes," "unicorn horn," or "legendary status"), and the all-important link to its image. It's like the table of contents and chapters of your NFT's story, revealing its hidden depths and making it verifiable on the blockchain.

## Generating Your 10K NFT Collection: Where Art Meets Automation

Now, let's get to the fun part – creating your massive collection of 10,000 unique NFTs! I know, 10,000 sounds like a lot (and it is!), but don't sweat it. We're going to harness the power of automation to make it a breeze. We'll use a handy image generator script that will do the heavy lifting for us, taking your base artwork and programmatically generating thousands of unique variations. It's like having an army of tiny digital artists working tirelessly to bring your vision to life!

### Step-by-Step Guide: Your NFT Assembly Line

#### **Installation**:

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. It's the engine that will power our image generator script.
2. Clone the 10k NFT image generator project from GitHub:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/10k-nft-image-generator.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
     cd 10k-nft-image-generator
    ```
    

> **Attention Mac users!!!!**
Run the following commands in **BASH** shell to successfully complete the next steps as some modules cause trouble on Mac but not on other platforms:
> 

```
touch ~/.bash_profile
curl -o- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh) | bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm --version
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
brew install python3
```

4. Next, open your terminal and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for the script:
    ```bash
     npm install
    ```
    
5. Finally, create an empty public GitHub repository (think of it as a digital gallery) and copy its HTTPS link. This is where we'll showcase your finished NFT collection. Paste the link into the `.env` file, next to the `GIT_REPO_URL` variable.

## Generating Images and Metadata

With everything set up, let the magic begin! Run the image generator script with this command:

```bash
 node generate.js
```

Watch as the script works its magic, churning out 10,000 unique NFT images and their corresponding metadata files. The images will be neatly tucked away in a folder called `generated_images`, while their digital DNA (metadata) will be stored in a folder called `generated_metadata`.

```jsx
{
  "name": "Sarielle Keogh #2",
  "description": "Sarielle Keogh is a Dwarf Cleric, who has no sibling(s), and was born Among people of a different race and rasied by their extended Family. Sarielle Keogh lives in the lower Isle of Zarkus, where she lives out her days as a Peasant. Sarielle Keogh was taught smithing at a young age as she often worked and helped out at her local smithery.",
  "image": "https://<your-github-page>.io/<repository-name>/generated_images/2.png",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Race",
      "value": "Dwarf"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Class",
      "value": "Cleric"
    },
    {
			.
			.
			.
			.
			.
			
  ]
}
```

---

Now, don’t get too confused with the image URI, since we are hosting the images on github pages, this is how the image URI format will look like!

> **Make sure to copy this URL `https://<your-github-page>.io/<repository-name>`. We will need it at the time of final compilation and deployment.**

Moving on!

## Uploading to GitHub

Time to share your creations with the world! Use this command to upload your freshly minted images and metadata to your GitHub repository:

```bash
 node upload.js
```

Your repository will now be a treasure trove of NFT goodness, ready to be discovered by eager collectors.

## Publishing Your Collection

1. Head over to your GitHub repository's settings and click on the "Pages" tab.
2. Choose "Deploy from a branch" and select the master branch.
3. Click "Save," and in a few minutes, your NFT collection will be live on a beautiful webpage powered by GitHub Pages!

Now, if you go to `metadata` folder and open any JSON file. Copy the image URL and paste it new tab, you can view the image.
