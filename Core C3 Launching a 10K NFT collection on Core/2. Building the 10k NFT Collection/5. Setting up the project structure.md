# Setting up the project structure

Hello, future NFT moguls! 🚀 Get ready to trade in your paintbrushes and sketchpads for lines of code and smart contracts, because today, we're building the ultimate digital workshop for your NFT creations! No more daydreaming about those unique collectibles – it's time to make them a reality on the blockchain.

In this lesson, we'll gather all the tools you need to mint, manage, and showcase your 10K NFT collection like a pro. We'll cover everything from installing essential software to setting up your project structure.  So grab your metaphorical hard hat, and let's get this NFT party started!

## Tool Time: Gathering Your Gear

Before we dive into the coding fun, we need to gather some essential tools. Think of it like prepping your ingredients before baking a cake – you can't make deliciousness without the right stuff!

1. **Node.js & npm (or yarn):** Head over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
2. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** Grab it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the simple installation instructions.
3. **Git:** Grab it from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.
4. **Git CLI:** It allows to connect with git via the terminal, so let’s install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, and type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git. You might need to enter your GitHub password if you have yet to log in.
        6. Do not close this terminal!

Awesome, you are all set!! Good job!

### MetaMask

You can download MetaMask from [here](https://metamask.io/).

This handy browser extension is your gateway to the blockchain world. It acts as your crypto wallet, allowing you to securely store and manage your NFTs. You'll also use it to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and connect to the blockchain of your choice.

Extract your public address and private key from the MetaMask Chrome extension as we will need them later on, follow these steps:

- Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
- Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your account card.
- Select "Account details" from the dropdown menu.
- You'll see your **public address** displayed at the top. Copy it for later use.
- To export your **private key**, click on "Show private key."
- Enter your MetaMask password to confirm.
- Click and hold the button to reveal your private key.
- Copy your private key and store it securely. Remember, never share your private key with anyone.

**We suggest keeping these pieces of information handy as we'll need them.** 

## Adding the Core Testnet to MetaMask: Your Blockchain Playground

Imagine the Core testnet as your personal blockchain playground. You can experiment, test your dApps, and make mistakes without worrying about real-world consequences.

Let’s add it to MetaMask so you can access it:

1. **Open MetaMask:** Click on the little fox icon in your browser (or open the app).
2. **Network Dropdown:** Click the dropdown menu at the top where it usually says "Ethereum Mainnet."
3. **Custom RPC:** Scroll down and select "Add network".
4. This will open a tab in the browser, click on “Add network manually” there.
5. **Enter Details:** Fill in the following information, double-checking that it's correct:
    - **Network Name:** Core Testnet
    - **New RPC URL:** [https://rpc.test.btcs.network](https://rpc.test.btcs.network/)
    - **ChainID:** 1115
    - **Symbol:** CORE
6. **Save:** Hit "Save," and you're in! It will ask you to switch to the network, well switch!

You can explore more Core Blockchain RPC links [here](https://docs.coredao.org/docs/Dev-Guide/rpc-list).

### Fetching Some Test tokens

Well, we know that we need test tokens to run any transaction on the blockchain, so let’s fetch some.

1. Head over to Core testnet faucet: [https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet).
2. Enter your wallet address which is the same public address we had copied up in the previous lesson.
3. Click on “Get tCORE”.
4. View your Metamask, you might have received 1 CORE.
