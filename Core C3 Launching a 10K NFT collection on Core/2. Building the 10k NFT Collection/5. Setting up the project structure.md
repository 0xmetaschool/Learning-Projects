# Setting up the project structure

Hello, future NFT moguls! üöÄ Get ready to trade in your paintbrushes and sketchpads for lines of code and smart contracts, because today, we're building the ultimate digital workshop for your NFT creations! No more daydreaming about those unique collectibles ‚Äì it's time to make them a reality on the blockchain.

In this lesson, we'll gather all the tools you need to mint, manage, and showcase your 10K NFT collection like a pro. We'll cover everything from installing essential software to setting up your project structure.  So grab your metaphorical hard hat, and let's get this NFT party started!

## Tool Time: Gathering Your Gear

Before we dive into the coding fun, we need to gather some essential tools. Think of it like prepping your ingredients before baking a cake ‚Äì you can't make deliciousness without the right stuff!

1. **Node.js & npm (or yarn):** Head over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
2. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** Grab it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the simple installation instructions.
3. **Git:** Grab it from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.
4. **Git CLI:** It allows to connect with git via the terminal, so let‚Äôs install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, and type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git. You might need to enter your GitHub password if you have yet to log in.
        6. Do not close this terminal!

Awesome, you are all set!! Good job!

### MetaMask

You can download MetaMask from [here](https://metamask.io/).

This handy browser extension is your gateway to the blockchain world. It acts as your crypto wallet, allowing you to securely store and manage your NFTs. You'll also use it to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and connect to the blockchain of your choice.

Extract your public address and private key from the MetaMask Chrome extension as we will need them later on, follow these steps:

- Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
- Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of your account card.
- Select "Account details" from the dropdown menu.
- You'll see your **public address** displayed at the top. Copy it for later use.
- To export your **private key**, click on "Show private key."
- Enter your MetaMask password to confirm.
- Click and hold the button to reveal your private key.
- Copy your private key and store it securely. Remember, never share your private key with anyone.

**We suggest keeping these pieces of information handy as we'll need them.** 

## Adding the Core Testnet to MetaMask: Your Blockchain Playground

Imagine the Core testnet as your personal blockchain playground. You can experiment, test your dApps, and make mistakes without worrying about real-world consequences.

Let‚Äôs add it to MetaMask so you can access it:

1. **Open MetaMask:** Click on the little fox icon in your browser (or open the app).
2. **Network Dropdown:** Click the dropdown menu at the top where it usually says "Ethereum Mainnet."
3. **Custom RPC:** Scroll down and select "Add network".
4. This will open a tab in the browser, click on ‚ÄúAdd network manually‚Äù there.
5. **Enter Details:** Fill in the following information, double-checking that it's correct:
    - **Network Name:** Core Testnet
    - **New RPC URL:** [https://rpc.test.btcs.network](https://rpc.test.btcs.network/)
    - **ChainID:** 1115
    - **Symbol:** tCORE
6. **Save:** Hit "Save," and you're in! It will ask you to switch to the network, well switch!

You can explore more Core Blockchain RPC links [here](https://docs.coredao.org/docs/Dev-Guide/rpc-list).

### Fetching Some Test tokens

Well, we know that we need test tokens to run any transaction on the blockchain, so let‚Äôs fetch some.

1. Head over to Core testnet faucet: [https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet).
2. Enter your wallet address which is the same public address we had copied up in the previous lesson.
3. Click on ‚ÄúGet tCORE‚Äù.
4. View your Metamask, you might have received 1 CORE.

## Set Up Your Project

Hardhat is our secret weapon for smart contract development! It simplifies everything from testing your code to deploying it on the blockchain. You can think of it as your blockchain toolkit. Well, instead of building everything from scratch, we have made it easy for you by providing a boilerplate code. This will help you to start right away~

Run the following command in your terminal:

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/10k-nft-boilderplate.git --clone 
```

This will clone the boilerplate code of your project onto your system and fork the repository to your Git account as well.

Now run these commands:

```
cd 10k-nft-boilderplate/backend 
npm install
```

This will download and install Hardhat, its dependencies, and other code libraries like `ether.js` that it needs to work.

## Configuring Hardhat for Core

Now, let's tell Hardhat about our new playground (the Core testnet). This will allow it to connect to the network and deploy our contracts on the Core testnet.

Create a `.env` file in `10k-nft-boilderplate/backend` folder and add the following content to it.

```
PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

We copied our private key, well, here we will use it. Paste the private key into your `.env` file in between the `‚Äú‚Äù`. And we are set!

YOU ARE ALL SET!!!!

## That‚Äôs a Wrap

With your toolbox overflowing with awesome tools, you're ready to build your NFT workshop! In our next lesson, we'll create the framework for your project, organizing your code and assets into neat folders. We'll also show you how to connect your project to your preferred blockchain, so you can start minting NFTs like a pro. Get ready to flex those coding muscles and bring your NFT dreams to life! üé®
