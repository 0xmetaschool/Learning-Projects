# Let‚Äôs Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned till now.

## Building the 10k NFT Collection

One of the most interesting parts of the course was that we built our very own 10K NFT collection! We used an image generator to generate NFT images from different layers. Not just that, we even created our very own smart contract to mint NFT.

## Deploy and Interact with Contract

Another super interesting part filled with learning, was when we deployed our NFT contract on Core and interacted with it through frontend. And that‚Äôs how we built a full-fledged project which not only creates a contract but also interacts with it through our frontend.  

You did great and we are so proud of you!
