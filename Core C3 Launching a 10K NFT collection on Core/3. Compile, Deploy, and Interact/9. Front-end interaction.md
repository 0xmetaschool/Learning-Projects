# Front-end interaction

Hey there, NFT visionaries! üöÄ We've minted our 10K NFT collection and deployed our trusty ERC-721 smart contract to the Core testnet. Now, it's time to roll out the red carpet and showcase our digital masterpieces to the world!

In this lesson, we'll be building a sleek and stylish frontend gallery that allows users to browse, admire, and even purchase your NFTs. It's like curating your very own digital art exhibit but without the pretentious wine and cheese! üç∑üßÄ

## Navigating to Your Frontend Directory

Assuming you've been following the chapters with the precision of an artist, your project structure should look like this:

```arduino
10k-nft-boilderplate/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/           // Your smart contracts and deployment scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/          // The React frontend we'll be working with
```

To start working on the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory using your terminal:

```bash
 cd frontend
```

This is where the magic of bringing your NFTs to life happens!

## Installing Dependencies: Powering Up Your Gallery

Just like a gallery needs lights, walls, and a security system, your frontend needs some essential software tools to run smoothly. Think of these dependencies as the building blocks of your gallery's infrastructure:

### Install Dependencies

Open your terminal (while still in the frontend directory) and run the following command:

```bash
 npm install
```

This will fetch and install all the necessary packages and libraries that your frontend project needs to function properly. Think of it as a shopping spree for your project, gathering all the right tools and materials to make it shine!

## Adding the Contract ABI: The Secret Decoder Ring

Now, let's give your frontend the ability to talk to your smart contract. You'll need to copy the `.json` files containing the ABI (Application Binary Interface) from the backend directory.

### Steps to Add the ABI:

1. **Locate ABI Files:** The ABI files are usually in the `backend/artifacts/contracts` folder. In this case, we need the `CoreNFT.json` file, which describes the structure and functions of your NFT smart contract.
2. **Copy and Paste:** Create a new folder, `ABI` inside `frontend/src`.  Copy the `CoreNFT.json` file and paste it into the `frontend/src/ABI/` folder. This will give your frontend the decoder ring it needs to understand and interact with your smart contract. Think of it as teaching your gallery how to speak the language of the blockchain!

## Launching Your NFT Gallery: Opening Night!

With everything in place, it's time to unveil your digital art exhibit to the world!

### Start the Development Server

In your terminal (still in the frontend directory), run the following command:

```bash
 npm start
```

This will compile your frontend code and launch a local development server. You should see a new browser window or tab open automatically, displaying your NFT gallery.

### View Your Masterpieces

Marvel at your beautiful creation! Your frontend gallery should now be displaying your 10K NFT collection in all its glory. Just ***paste the deployed address of the NFT contract*** and you'll see the images of your NFTs, their names, descriptions, and any other metadata you've included. You can even interact with the smart contract to view ownership details or transfer NFTs.

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `10k-nft-boilderplate` folder. Remember to push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 

```solidity
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## Wrapping Up: Your NFT Journey Continues!

Congratulations! You've successfully built your very own NFT collection and launched a stunning frontend gallery to showcase it to the world. This is a major milestone, but the journey doesn't end here.

In our final lesson, we'll recap everything we've learned. So, stay tuned for one last adventure in the world of digital collectibles! üöÄ
