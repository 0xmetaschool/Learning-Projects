# Compiling and Deploying Contract

Welcome back to another new lesson! Now that we are done with writing our smart contract, let’s deploy the NFT contract. Sounds interesting, right? Let’s get started!! 

## Compiling the contract

Make sure you are in `10k-nft-boilderplate/backend/` folder.

Let’s compile our contract using:

```jsx
npx hardhat compile
```

On successful compilation, you should see something like so: 

![core-c3-l8.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Core%20C3%2010k%20NFT%20Images/Lesson%208%20Compiling%20and%20Deploying%20Contract/core-c3-l8.webp?raw=true)

## Deploying the Contract

Now finally, let’s deploy the contract on Core Testnet. Before deploying, make sure, you have added Core testnet to your Metamask wallet and have funded it with test tokens as mentioned in the previous lessons. 

Navigate to `backend/ignition/modules/NFT.js` and we have the deployment file there. It imports the `buildModule` function, creates an NFT module, fetches the `CoreNFT` contract, and exports it for use in the Hardhat project.

> **Remember I asked you to copy your image URL in the lesson `Creating a 10,000-Piece NFT Collection`. Using that info, replace `<your-github-page>` and `<repository-name>` with your info in the following code.
> Let me remind you where you can fetch the info. Just go to your image collection repo open any JSON file from your metadata folder and copy the URL.**

```jsx
const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

module.exports = buildModule("NFTModule", (m) => {

  const nft = m.contract("CoreNFT", ["https://<your-github-page>.io/<repository-name>/generated_metadata/"]);

  return { nft };
});
```

You can now deploy using:

```solidity
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/NFT.js --network core_testnet
```

It will ask to confirm the deployment. Press `y`. Once, it's deployed, you will see something like below. Copy your deployed address.

## Checking Transaction on Block Explorer

We can use Core Scan to check our transactions. To do that, let’s go to [this](https://scan.test.btcs.network/) link.

Once you are there, paste the address you received in the previous step in the search bar. You can now see that you have made the transaction:

## Verifying our Contract

To verify the contract, we first need to add our API Key from Core Scan to our `.env` file. Let’s see how we can do that:

- Go [here](https://scan.test.btcs.network/) and create your account
- Once your account is created, when you go to your profile, you will see an option API-KEYs.

- You can now click on `add` and create your API Key, we have named it `my_key`, but you can name it anything you want.

Once we have our key, let’s copy it and paste it into our `.env` file by assigning it to `API_KEY`

Our `.env` file now looks like this:

```jsx
PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

We are now finally ready to verify our contract! We need to follow just one last step to verify our contract. To do that, you can simply replace `<CONTRACT ADDRESS>` below with your deployed contract address you got during the last step: 

```jsx
npx hardhat verify --network core_testnet <CONTRACT ADDRESS> "https://corenft.vercel.app/generated_metadata/"
```

If the verification is done correctly, you should see something like this:

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `10k-nft-boilderplate/backend/` folder. Remember to push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 

```solidity
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## Wrap Up

Congratulations!! You have achieved a lot in this lesson! From compiling the contract to deploying it and even verifying your contract. You have done it all! You have even checked your transaction on Core Scan. Well done! In the next lesson, we will interact with the frontend. See you there!
