# Building the YeBot!

Now, letâ€™s dive into the dope world of the YeAI Bot Project. This project is all about creating a Kanye West AI bot that can chat with you and answer your questions in Kanye West style. Itâ€™s gonna be a blast!

## Key Features of YeBot

Check out some of the key features of the YeAI Bot Project:

- Understanding natural language input so you can talk to it like a real person.
- Use of the amazing openAI GPT-4 model to generate responses that sound real.
- Personalizing responses based on your interactions and data, so it feels like youâ€™re chatting with a real Kanye West.
- Integrate the model with NextJS and run the server using npm.

## Letâ€™s Get It Started: Code & Prompts

Weâ€™ll be using code and prompts to build our YeBot, with the OpenAI engine as the backbone of our chatbot. Weâ€™ll set up our development environment and use the OpenAI API key that weâ€™ve already generated for this purpose. To build the frontend, weâ€™ll be using NextJS which will allow us to create an interactive and dynamic user interface for our Kanye West AI chatbot.

**Donâ€™t Worry**! We will explain everything one-by-one. So, letâ€™s buckle up to learn and build!

## So, why use Next.js for building a YeAI bot?

Next.js is a super cool framework for building web apps, and itâ€™s perfect for building dope projects like a Kanye West AI bot using OpenAI API. Let me break it down for you real quick:

- Itâ€™s perfect for building complex apps that require dynamic data and frequent updates, like our YeAI bot thatâ€™s constantly learning and evolving.
- Itâ€™s super fast and efficient, which is important when youâ€™re dealing with large amounts of data and processing power, which our GPT model will be using to give us responses.
- Itâ€™s easy to use and has a ton of awesome features that will make building your AI bot a breeze.
- Itâ€™s super fun and exciting to work with, especially when youâ€™re building something as cool as a Kanye West AI bot!

## Getting started with Node.js

Let's dive into setting up the YeBot! project. We'll be using Node.js and Next.js to create an AI chatbot that responds in the style of Kanye West.

### Setting Up Node.js

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Initializing the Project

- Open your terminal and create a new directory for the project:
    
    ```solidity
    mkdir KanyeWest-Bot
    cd KanyeWest-Bot
    ```
    
- Initialize the project with npm:
    
    ```solidity
    npm init -y
    ```
    
    This creates a `package.json` file that will manage our project dependencies.
    
- Install the necessary dependencies:
    
    ```solidity
    npm install next react react-dom axios dotenv
    ```
    

## Creating the Chatbot

Now, let's create the core of our chatbot. Create a new file called `chatbot.js` in your project directory and add the following code:

```solidity
const axios = require('axios');
require('dotenv').config();

async function getKanyeResponse(userMessage) {
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content: 'Respond as if you are Kanye West, the iconic rapper and producer known for his bold, passionate, and often controversial statements, characterized by a confident, stream-of-consciousness style, inventive language, and a mix of emotional intensity and unpredictable tweets.'
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: userMessage,
        },
      ],
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    return response.data.choices[0]?.message?.content || 'No response from bot';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

module.exports = { getKanyeResponse };
```

- We import the `axios` library to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
- We use `dotenv` to load environment variables from a .env file.
- We define an async function `getKanyeResponse` that takes a `userMessage` as input.
- We retrieve the OpenAI API key from the environment variables.
- We make a POST request to the OpenAI API's chat completions endpoint.
- We specify the `gpt-4` model and provide two messages:
    - A system message that instructs the model to respond as Kanye West.
    - The user's message.
- We set the necessary headers, including the API key for authorization.
- We return the content of the first choice from the API response, or a default message if no response is received.
- If an error occurs, we log it and throw it for handling elsewhere.
- We export the `getKanyeResponse` function so it can be used in other parts of the application.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To keep your API key secure, create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

With these steps completed, you've laid the foundation for the KanyeWest-Bot project. The next steps will involve setting up the server and creating the frontend interface.

# Wrap Up

Alright, we've just dropped some serious knowledge about setting up this Ye-inspired chatbot. We've got our Node.js file flexing with `dotenv` for keeping those API keys on the down-low, and `axios` for sliding into OpenAI's DMs. We're hitting up that GPT-4 model to channel Kanye's vibe, and we've tucked away our API key in a sneaky little `.env` file like it's a limited edition Yeezy drop. Now when you run that `node chatbot.js`, you're basically summoning Ye's spirit into your terminal. It's not just code, it's a whole mood. You're not just a developer now, you're a digital Ye whisperer. Keep it wavy, and may your responses be as bold as Kanye's tweets. ðŸŒŠ
