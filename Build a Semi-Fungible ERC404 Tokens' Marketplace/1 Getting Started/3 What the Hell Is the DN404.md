# What the Hell Is the DN404?

We’re so proud of you for covering all about the ERC404 token standard. Now, we will explore the shortcomings of ERC404 and get to know about the DN404 in detail.

## ERC404 hype

You must have heard of the statement that with great responsibility comes a great price. This is what happened with the ERC404. ERC404 hype caused the high gas fees among the Ethereum  ecosystem which made it even more difficult for developers like you and us to create the custom ERC20 tokens.

This is where the DN404 came into the picture. Out of frustration and to resolve the gas fees issue, a group of developers introduced “Divisible NFT-404” token (DN404).

DN404 is built upon the established and up to date ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. It introduce the better approach to manage the user balance and NFTs seperately. This setup promises a smoother experience for users and more efficient handling of tokens.

## How does the DN404 work?

DN404 offers almost 20% reduction in gas fees. The DN404 differs from ERC404 in the contract structure. The ERC404 merge the ERC20 and ERC721 tokens standard functionalities into the one contract. While, DN404 uses two separate contracts for a standard ERC20 token and a mirrored ERC721 token. However, the developers argue that this approach will cause the security risk.

However, both ERC404 and DN404, are experimental tokens. Both are not approved by Ethereum as official standards.

## That’s a wrap

In this course, we will use the DN404 to implement the token and create a marketplace for it. So, stay tuned and start building! 

In the next lesson, we will setup the development environment and install important dependencies.
