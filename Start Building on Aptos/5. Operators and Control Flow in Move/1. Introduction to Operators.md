# Introduction to Operators

Well, the whole point of a programming language is to help you 🫵, The Developer, manipulate data and perform a series of operations to achieve the results you want. Whether you're building a simple calculator or a complex application, operators are the fundamental tools that make it all possible.

In the case of our calculator dApp, we need it to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are the backbone of any calculator, and understanding how to implement them using operators in Move is crucial.

## Operators in Move

Much like every other programming, Solidity has a special set of symbols called operators that can be used to perform specific operations on data. Depending on the type of data that these operators work on and operation that they do, we can categorize these operators onto following types. 

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
    
    These are the go-to operators for basic math, just like you use in everyday calculations. They work on numerical data types, such as `uint`, `int`, and `uint256`.

2. **Relational Operators**
    
    These help you compare values to see how they relate. They work on numerical data types (`uint`, `int`, `uint256`) and also on `bool` types for equality and inequality checks. We will be needing them soon enough in the upcoming lessons.

3. **Logical Operators**
    
    These are like the logical words you use in everyday conversation, helping you decide based on multiple conditions. They work on `bool` types.

4. **Bitwise Operators**
    
    These work with the individual bits (0s and 1s) in your data. They operate on `uint`types.

5. **Assignment Operators**
    
    These are used to assign values to your variables or change their current values. They work on numerical and Boolean data types.

6. **Conditional Operators**
    
    This is a shorthand for if-else statements. It works on any data types that can be evaluated in a condition. A compact way to return one of two values based on a condition. It uses the syntax 
    
    ```
    condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
    ```
    

Most of these operators work similarly to how they do in other programming languages, making them easy to understand and use if you're already familiar with languages like JavaScript, C++, or Python. We're mostly just listing these operators out to show their specific applications in Move.

## Code Makeover: Adding Operators

Alright, let's tweak our code to make sure it’s crunching the right numbers in all our functions. First things first, we need to change the data type of the result we're returning.

In the previous lesson, we set the `result` field as `vector<u8>` to handle strings. But let's be real, a calculator that doesn't return numbers is like a keyboard without keys, pretty useless!😅 So, let's update that to `u64` so we can return a number. Because, after all, we want our calculator to be number one at returning numbers, right?

```
struct Calculator has key {
   result: u64, // Result will be of type u64
} 
```

Now, let's focus on our `add()` function. We're going to put the `+` operator to work and sum up both of our function parameters. This will set the value of `result` to their total.

```
public entry fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
    let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
    calculator.result = num1 + num2; // updating value of result field

    get_result(account);
}
```

First, it gets a mutable reference to our `Calculator` struct using the account's address. Then, it sums `num1` and `num2` with the `+` operator and updates the `result` field with this value. Finally, it calls `get_result(account)` to fetch the updated result. And just like that, our calculator is ready to add things up!

## That’s a Wrap

Great job! In this lesson, we learned how to update our code to handle numerical results by changing the `result` field to `u64`, and we used the `+` operator in the `add()` function to sum values and update the result. With these skills, your calculator Dapp is on its way to becoming a fully functional number-crunching machine. Now, try to define the `multiply` function by yourself. You’ve got the basics down, so go ahead and put your new knowledge to the test.
