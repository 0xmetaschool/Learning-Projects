# Transform Your dApp Using Loop Scoop

Hey there, welcome back! Last time, you got the hang of control statements and how they help you tackle all those tricky edge cases. Now, we're going to dive into loops and see how they can help us implement the power function in our `calculator` dApp.

Ever heard the saying, "Work smarter, not harder"? Well, loops in coding are like your personal smart assistant—they take care of repetitive tasks so you can focus on the fun stuff.

Picture this: you’ve got a bunch of tasks that need to be done over and over again. Throw them into a loop, and voila, your code does the heavy lifting while you sip your coffee.

In this lesson, we're diving into loops in Move programming. But wait, there's more! We'll also sprinkle in some cool keywords that add extra spice to your loops, making them even more powerful.

![loop.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Transform%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Loop%20Scoop/loop.gif?raw=true)

There are three loop constructs in Move that we’ll get familiar with:

1. **`while`**: A loop that repeats while a condition is true.
2. **`loop`**: A loop that repeats indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
3. **`for`**: A loop that iterates over a range of values or a collection.

Let’s explore how each of these works and see them in action with our `calculator` dApp!

## `while` loop

Let’s start with the `while` loop. The ‘`while`’ loop repeats the body until the condition, which is an expression of type bool, evaluates to false. 

```
while(boolean-expression)
{
	// body of the loop
};
```

It’s just the `while` keyword followed by a condition, here again, similar to conditionals we will be using relational operators to define conditions. The While loop will have a block of code within its scope, these are the set of instructions that will be repeated until the condition becomes false. So let’s make a while loop, now we need a condition and a set of instructions to be repeatedly executed until the condition becomes false.

Let’s make our `while` loop to find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. So we are going to need a variable `n`, a variable to store the sum, and one more variable, let’s call it `i` to track the the natural number we are adding to the sum. 

The value of `i` will start from 1 and should increase till it reaches `n` , so let’s add the condition to the loop that repeats if the value of i is less than equal 

```
module metaschool::Demo
{
    use std::debug as bug;
    fun sample_function(){
        let n = 5; 
        let sum = 0;
        let i = 1;
        while (i <= n) {
            sum = sum + i;
            i = i + 1
        };
        bug::print(&sum);
    }
}
```

 

Here, the `while` loop will repeatedly increment the value of the variable `sum` by the value of `i` until the condition becomes false, i.e., `i` does not become bigger than `n`. 

For the value of `n = 5` then what will the value of the sum after the loop ends?

The Correct answer will be 15. The Loop iterates until the condition becomes false, so for a value of `i = 6`, our Boolean expression will become false as 5 is not less than or equal to 5. So the value of the sum will increment with value `i` which ranges from 1 to 5 so finally sum will be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, which equals 15.

## `loop` expression

Next up, we have the `loop` expression. It repeats the loop body until it hits a break. Without a `break` keyword, the loop will continue forever and you’ll have an infinite loop in your hands. 

```
loop {
	// Code
	if(condition) break; // necessary for stopping the loop	
}
```

Let’s take an example, Following is the same program for the sum of n natural numbers we saw in the case of a `while` loop but re-written to use `loop` expression along with `break` keyword.

```
   fun sample_function(){
        let n = 5; 
        let sum = 0;
        let i = 1;
        loop {
            if (i > n) break;
            sum = sum + i;
            i = i + 1;
        };
        bug::print(&sum);
    }
```

Here we are using the `break` keyword to explicitly stop the loop when the condition `(i > n)` becomes `true`. That’s one difference between the `while` and `loop` expressions. The `while` loop ends when the condition becomes false whereas the `loop` expression terminates when the condition becomes true to make the break statement come into play to stop the lopping.

Finally, Move loops are typed expressions. A `while` expression and `loop` expression containing a break will always have type as `()`. If the `loop` does not contain a `break`, the `loop` can have any type.

```
let () = while (i < 10) { i = i + 1 };

let () = loop { if (i < 10) i = i + 1 else break };
```

Let’s see a quick example.

```
fun sample_function(){
        let i: u8 = 0;
        let () = while (i < 10) { i = i + 1 };
        bug::print(&i);
    }
```

Inside the sample function, we declare a mutable variable `i` and initialize it to `0`. Next, we have a statement that utilizes a `while` loop with an empty block. This loop increments the value of `i` until it reaches 10.

## `for` loop

Finally, we have the good old `for` loop, Unlike the for Loop you might see in other programming languages, The `for` loop in Move is a bit special. it is used specifically in scenarios where you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a certain task. Most commonly used for iterating over a range or collection of values. 

Let’s take the same example back again. Imagine we want to compute the sum of numbers from 0 to n-1. 

```
fun sample_function(){
        let n = 5;
        let sum = 0;
        for (i in 0..n) { // Here, i iterates from 0 to n-1
            sum = sum + i; // Adding each value of i to sum
        };
        bug::print(&sum);
    }
```

In this code, the for loop is your hero. It starts at `0` (`i` is set to `0`), keeps going until it reaches `n - 1` (the upper_bound in the range), and does its thing inside the loop body for each value of `i`.

Now, a little trick – the `break` and `continue` keywords we've seen before can also be used in `for` loops. If you need to jump out of the loop early or skip certain iterations, these keywords have got your back.

## Let’s implement the power function in our calculator

Let's dive into the power function and see how it works with loops in our calculator dApp. To keep things tidy and neat, I'll show you just the power function here. We'll cover the complete code in the next lesson.

![power.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Transform%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Loop%20Scoop/power.gif?raw=true)

Ready? Let’s get powered up!

```
public entry fun power(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
  let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
  if (num2 == 0) {
      abort error::invalid_argument(0)
  } else {
      let i = 1;
      calculator.result = num1;
      while (i < num2){
          calculator.result = calculator.result * num1;
          i = i + 1;
      }

  };

  get_result(account);
}
```

Let’s understand what we did here in the code.

- The `power` function takes three arguments: `&signer` and two `u64` numbers.
- First, it checks if the second number is zero. If it is, the program aborts and shows an error to prompt the user for the correct input.
- In the `else` condition, we initialize a variable `i` with the value `1` and assign `num1` to the `calculator`'s `result` field.
- A while loop runs as long as `i` is smaller than `num2` because we need to multiply `num1` by itself `num2` times.
- Inside the while loop, we multiply `num1` by `calculator.result` and store the result back into `calculator.result`. We also increment the `i` variable.
- Finally, outside the if-else condition, we call `get_result(account);`, which retrieves the result for the signer's `calculator`.

Ready for the full code? We'll go through it in the next lesson! Stay tuned, rockstars!

## That’s a wrap

So there you have it, folks! Time to earn some brownie points. Try writing a loop to print all even numbers under 50. It's a fun challenge!

That's it for this lesson. In the next one, we'll compile all the calculator module code in one place, deploy it, and then interact with the frontend. Stay tuned for the grand finale!
