# Edge-case Ninjas in Action

Welcome back, folks!! Last time, you dove into the world of operators and successfully integrated them into your calculator dApp. Way to go!

In this lesson, we're going to unravel the magic of if and else conditions. You've already added these to your calculator dApp, but now, let's take a closer look to see how they really work and why they're so powerful. Let's get started!

## Control statements

Move gives you access to control statements that allow you to perform operations based on the condition. Think of control statements as the traffic signals in a busy intersection. They help direct the flow of traffic or in our case, code execution based on certain conditions.

For example, you want to buy a bar of chocolate but you decide if the chocolate has sugar you will not buy it and if it doesn’t you will buy it. Here, you put the conditions on your buying statement. Same as this we use control statements to put the condition before doing certain tasks. For example, if `num_1` is equal to 10 and `num_2` is equal to 20 then we will add these numbers otherwise we will subtract them.

## `if` statement

The last example we discussed can be achieved quite easily by using the `if` expression. The `if` expression is like a Swiss army knife when it comes to functionality and is useful in many scenarios. Let us demonstrate.

The basic working of an **`if`** expression is quite simple. It's as simple as saying “If it’s Sugar-free, then I will buy it”. The `if` expression specifies that some code should only be evaluated if a certain condition is true. The basic syntax goes like this.

```
 if ( boolean-expression )
 {
	 // true-branch
 };
```

The `if` statement is followed by a condition, generally a Boolean expression. This is exactly where the logical, equality, and comparison operators i.e. relational operators (`&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`) we discussed in the previous lessons will come in handy. Relational operators will always give a boolean value in return after evaluation. If the Boolean expression is evaluated as true then the branch of code specified in the scope of the `if`-expression will be executed. 

Let’s take an example to understand this better.

```
module example::if_statement
{
    use std::debug as bug;
    fun sample_function(){
    
        let a : u8 = 15;
        if(a == 15)
        {
            a = a + 5;
        };
        bug::print(&a);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have the `if` keyword followed by a Boolean expression which checks if the value of variable `a` is equal to `15` or not. For this example the value initialized to variable `a` is `15` so the expression inside the scope of the `if`-statement will execute, incrementing the value of variable `a` by 5. The code will give the `20` output.

But if the condition is not true, then in that case block of code will not be executed. For example:

```
module example::if_statement
{
    use std::debug as bug;
    fun sample_function(){
        let a : u8 = 15;
        if(a == 5)
        {
            a = a + 5;
        };
        bug::print(&a);
    }
}
```

In this code, we are checking if the value of the variable `a` is 5. But as the value initialized to **`a`** is not equal to 5, our condition is false. So the block of code will not be executed. And the value of a will NOT be incremented by 5. This code will print `15`.

## `else` statement

If there’s a requirement to perform some operations when the condition is false then the `else` clause comes in handy. The `else` **clause contains the branch of code to be executed when `if` the condition is false. 

![Group 14.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Edge-case%20Ninjas%20in%20Action/Group_14.png?raw=true)

The `else` has to be used along with the `if` statement or else we will be gifted with an error right on the spot.

```
if(false-condition)
{
	// false branch
}
else
{
	// true branch
};
```

Let’s try it out in our previous code. Here I have added the `else` clause to set the value of variable ‘`a`’ to 0 if the condition is false. 

```
module example::if_statement
{
    use std::debug as bug;		
    fun sample_function(){
        let a : u8 = 15;
        if(a == 5) // false condition
        {
            a = a + 5;
        }
        else
        {
            a = 0;
        };
        bug::print(&a);
    }
}
```

The code will print the `0` output.

The conditional expressions can produce values if needed, i.e. it can return a result. This comes especially handy if you want to initialize a value to a variable based on a condition. For example, 

```
module example::if_statement
{
    use std::debug as bug;	
    fun sample_function(){
        let a:u8 = 5;
        let b:u8 = 10;
        let c = if (a < 100) a else b;
        bug::print(&b);
    }    
}
```

Let’s swap out the expression for values, We will change the true branch to give out variable `a` and the false branch to `b`. The value of variable `c` is assigned based on the condition of whether the value of `a` is less than 100 or not. As the value of the so-called variable is less than 100 then the value assigned to variable `b` will be equal to `a` i.e. it will be equal to 5. So, at last the code will print `10`.

## Code makeover: Adding subtraction and division

Let’s look at the `create_calculator` that we have already built in our `calculator` module, add a division function, and understand how if-else conditions are helping us in the code.

### create_calculator

```
fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
    if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
    
        // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        
        calculator.result = 0;
    }
    else {
    
      // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
      let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
      
      move_to(account, calculator);
    }
}
```

Let us explain how if-else conditions work in the `create_calculator`  function.

- The if condition here helps us identify if the signer address already has a `Calculator` resource or not. If it does we fetch and modify the result field.
- The else condition helps us create a new resource and move it to the signer address if the signer address already doesn’t have the resource.

### divide

```
public entry fun divide(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
    let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
    if (num2 == 0) {
        abort error::invalid_argument(0)
    } else {
        calculator.result = num1 / num2;
    };

    get_result(account);
}
```

Here, we are again fetching the `Calculator` resource from the signer's address first then using the condition to check if the `num2` given is equal to `0` or not. Because if it is equal to `0` then the division is not possible and we abort.

## That’s a wrap

That’s all folks!! It is very important to get familiar with conditionals because they always come in handy. You want to check if the number is even or odd using conditionals or you want to assign value to a variable only if the value is even, you’ll need to work with the conditionals.

Try running all the examples mentioned in this lesson on your system and check the output. See what you get.
