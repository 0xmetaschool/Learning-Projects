# Let’s Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned and how it can empower you in the world of blockchain development.

## What You Built

A branded MetaSchool calculator dApp on the Aptos blockchain. It had the following key features:

- **Performed basic calculations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
- **Handled advanced operations**: modulo, power calculation, logical and comparison operators

## What We Covered

We covered the following:

- **Introduction:** Got an overview of Aptos, dApps, Move programming language, and the course structure.
- **Understanding Basic Concepts:** We broke down the basics of blockchain, smart contracts, and the Move programming language used for building Aptos dApps.
- **Getting Started with Development:** Learnt how to set up your development environment using the Aptos CLI. You installed the necessary tools, created a wallet, and understood the project structure for your calculator dApp.
- **Building Your Calculator Project:** We wrote the Move code for your dApp. You learned about modules, and directory structure, and deployed your first smart contract.
- **Structuring Your dApp and Adding Resources:** Explored the concept of structs and resources in Move, crucial for building dApps like your calculator. You learned how to define structs and resources and integrated them into your dApp.
- **Variables, Constants, Functions & Control Flow:** You learned how to define variables, constants, and functions with different visibility levels (public/private) for your dApp. We explored operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison) and control flow statements (if/else, loops) to handle user input and calculations.
- **Deploy and Interact:** Learned how to deploy your dApp to the Aptos testnet and interact with it. We discussed the process of deploying to the mainnet.
