# Variable Vibes and Constant Fun in Your Calculator

Welcome back, rockstars! ü§ò We‚Äôre thrilled to see you again, ready to dive into more knowledge. Last time, you mastered resources, learned how to add abilities to them, and discovered the art of resource manipulation with various functions.

Now, it‚Äôs time to level up! We‚Äôre going to explore how to create variables and constants in Move. While our calculator dApp might not need tons of variables or constants, understanding them is crucial. They help us save important data and grasp how to work with functions and structs.

Before we dive in, let‚Äôs figure out how to add data to a module. In coding, we call this data ‚Äúvariables.‚Äù They help us store anything‚Äînumbers, strings, or even conditions like true or false. For example, in our Calculator struct, we have a result field that stores the calculation result.

So, let‚Äôs break it down and understand the different types of variables first!

## Different types of variables: Mutable vs immutable variables

There are two types of variables: mutable and immutable variables. Let‚Äôs try to understand them.

### Mutable Variables

Mutable variables can change. You can store data in them and modify it later. For example, if you set a variable `var` to `10`, you can change it to `5` whenever you want. Easy, right?

### Immutable Variables

Immutable variables, on the other hand, cannot be changed once data is stored in them. Imagine you have a cookie recipe that always uses brown sugar. You write it down as `sugar = "brown sugar"`. If someone changes it to `"salt"` without you knowing, your cookies will come out salty! That‚Äôs why immutable variables are essential‚Äîthey keep your data safe and unchanged.

Now that we‚Äôve got the basics down, let‚Äôs jump into how Move handles variables.

## Variables in Move

In Move, we use two main keywords to store data: `let` and `const`. `let` is for mutable variables, and `const` is for immutable variables, aka constants. Let‚Äôs see how they work!

## `let` keyword

In Move, we use the `let` keyword to declare and initialize the variables. After declaring the variable, you can easily access and modify it later. There are several ways to declare and initialize the variable using the `let` keyword. Let‚Äôs discuss them in detail.

```
let <Variable_Name> : <Type>
```

Here, we are simply using the `let` keyword to name the variable and define the type of the variable. Here‚Äôs the coding example where we are just declaring the variable. This means we are not storing any data in the variable, for now, we are just defining and declaring the variable. Keep in mind you can do this in Move without initializing the variables.

```
let a : u8;
let b : u8;
```

In this example, we simply declared `a` and `b` variables using the `let` keyword. Remember `u8` is used to identify that `a` and `b` are integers. Don‚Äôt worry about this for now. We will cover data types in detail in the upcoming lessons.

Now, let‚Äôs initialize the variable meaning let‚Äôs just not declare the variable but also store the data in the variables. Even if we store data after declaring the variable it means we are initializing the variables. Here‚Äôs the simple structure to do so.

```
let <Variable> = <Expression>
let <Variable> : <Type> = <Expression>
```

Let‚Äôs look at some examples now. Remember, it is mandatory to include semicolons at the end of each line in Move.

```
let a : u8;
a = 1;
let b : u8; 
b = 2;
let sum : u8 = a + b; 
sum = sum + b;
```

Here, we first declared `a` and `b` variables and then initialized them using the values. Afterward, we declared and initialized the `sum` variable in a single line. In the end, we tried to change the value of the sum variable.

Also, you can define a struct variable using the `let` keyword. Just like we defined `calculator` variable in our `calculator` dApp.

```
// Rsource with key ability
struct Calculator has key {
    result: u64,
}

// Defining resource variable using the let keyword
let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
```

Here, we defined the variable of the resource type `Calculator` using the `let` keyword.

**Note:** Variables should always start with a small alphabet (`a`-`z`) or an underscore(`_`). After the first letter, variables can have underscores, small alphabets (`a`-`z`), upper case alphabets (`A`-`Z`), or digits(`0`-`9`). For example, `simple_u8`, `simpleU8`, etc are valid variable names.

Simple, isn‚Äôt it? Let‚Äôs move on to another way of declaring the variable. It is important to learn this because even if we don‚Äôt use it in our `calculator` dApp it will help us build many other dApps on Aptos Move.

## `const` keyword

In Move, the `const` keyword declares and initializes constants.

![Frame 3560404.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Variable%20Vibes%20and%20Constant%20Fun%20in%20Your%20Calculat/Frame_3560404.gif?raw=true)

Constants are defined at the module level, meaning they‚Äôre initialized outside of functions and can be used anywhere in the module. Here‚Äôs the syntax:

```
const <Variable> : <Type> = <Expression>
```

A few key points about constants:

- They cannot be changed once defined.
- They must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- They‚Äôre mostly used to define module-level constant values.
- They‚Äôre private to the module and cannot be accessed by other modules.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```
module example::constants {
    const MAX : u64 = 100;

    fun sample_function(){
        let num = MAX;
    }
}
```

Here, we declared and initialized the `MAX` constant globally, allowing it to be used anywhere inside the module.

**> Note:** Constant names should be uppercase or use upper snake case, like `MAX` or `MAX_SUM`.

## Let‚Äôs understand the variables used in calculator dApp

So, let‚Äôs understand how we defined the struct variables in our last lesson.

```
module metaschool::calculator {

		// Rsource with key ability
    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

    fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
        
		        // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            
            calculator.result = 0;
        }
        else {
        
	        // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
	        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
	        
	        move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code:

1. We define the `calculator` variable inside the `if` condition.
2. We also define the `calculator` variable inside the `else` condition.

## That‚Äôs a wrap

And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre now equipped with the knowledge of how to declare and use variables and constants in Move. Keep rocking the blockchain world! üöÄ¬†Next, we‚Äôll learn all about the data types available in Aptos Move.
