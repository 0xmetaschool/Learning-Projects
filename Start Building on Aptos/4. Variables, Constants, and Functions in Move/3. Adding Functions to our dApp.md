# Letâ€™s Make Our Calculator to Function

Alright, our calculator dApp, though simple, can perform a bunch of algebraic operations. But cramming all that code into one place? Thatâ€™s a recipe for a headache!ðŸ¤¯ It would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack if something goes wrong. Thatâ€™s where functions come to the rescue. They help us chop our code into bite-sized, manageable pieces, making it a piece of cake to read, understand, and fix. So, letâ€™s dive in and start slicing and dicing our code!

## What is a Function?

A function in Move is a block of code that performs a specific task. Call a function and it does its magic and gives you an output with or without an input as per the requirement. Functions help keep your code organized, modular, and easy to manage. Our calculator has a bunch of specific algebraic operations to take care of, So we will be making separate functions for each and every other operation. Letâ€™s see how you can create and take complete advantage of modular programming.

## Function declaration

Firstly, in Move, you can define a function using a `fun` keyword. It looks something like this -

```
fun <function_name> (<parameters_list>): <return_type_if_any> {
	<function_body>
}
```

You can define the list of parameters your function will take and also optionally, if you want to return a particular type of output.

## Function call

One thing you need to remember about the function is that to execute the function, you need to call the function. And how do you do that? 

To call the function, the name should be followed by parenthesis `()`. Letâ€™s take an example of add function `add`. You can call this function using `add()` like below: 

```
module examples::function
{
    use std::debug as bug;

    fun add(){
	    // code goes here
    }
    
    fun call_add_function() {
	    add(); // Calling add function
    }
}
```

## Function arguments

You can imagine the function arguments like the number you press to get a particular item say chips from a vending machine. For the `add` function, you if want to add two numbers 5 and 10, you would pass them as an argument as long as it supports adding two numbers. Letâ€™s take a look at the example below which does exactly that.

```
module examples::function
{
    use std::debug as bug;

    fun add(number_1: u8, number_2: u8){
        // function code goes here
    }
}
```

## Function return

Now, how do we return a value from the function? To do so we **DONâ€™T** need a `return` keyword in Move. We write an expression, a variable name, and a function name that returns any value without any other keyword at the end of the function. Letâ€™s look at this coding example.

```
module metaschool::Demo {
    use std::debug as bug;

    fun add(number_1: u8, number_2: u8): u8 {
        // function code goes here
        number_1 + number_2
    }

    fun call_add_function() {
        let result = add(5, 10);
    }
}
```

Here, the `add` function returns the value of `number_1 + number_2` of type `u8` which is then stored inside of the result. 

We can also return multiple variables in Move. To do so, we concatenate all data types in brackets and use commas to separate them. Letâ€™s look at this example.

```
module metaschool::Demo {
	use std::debug as bug;
    fun add(number_1: u8, number_2: u8) : (u8,u8,u8) {
        (number_1 + number_2, number_1*number_2 , number_2 - number_1)
    }

    fun call_add_function() {
        let (sum, product, diff) = add(5, 10);
        bug::print(&sum);
        bug::print(&diff);
        bug::print(&product);
    }
}
```

Here, we defined multiple return types inside of the parenthesis and then returned multiple data using the parenthesis again. This type of syntax where we concatenate multiple values inside of the brackets is also known as tuple notation.

## Letâ€™s make our calculator function

Just as we mentioned at the start, our calculator will perform multiple algebraic operations. To keep things organized, weâ€™ll create individual functions for each operation. To make sure you can follow along easily, we've prepared a boilerplate along with the frontend for you to use. Dive in and let's get coding!

1. Clone our repository by running the following command :
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate.git
    cd Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate
    git fetch --all
    git checkout boilerplate_03
    ```
    
2. Open the folder using VS code and you can now start coding in this pre-configured move file.
    
    ![Untitled](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Adding%20Functions%20to%20our%20dApp/Untitled.png?raw=true)
    

Letâ€™s kick things off with a function that wonâ€™t do any heavy lifting in terms of number crunching, but it's crucial for our frontend. This function, called `get_result()`, will simply return the value of the result field back to our frontend. So letâ€™s add this function into our move file

```
fun get_result(account: &signer): vector<u8> acquires Calculator {
    let calculator = borrow_global<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
    calculator.result
}
```

- We're defining a function named `get_result` using the `fun` keyword.
- The function takes one parameter: `account`. It is a parameter of type `&signer`, which represents the account performing the operation. We need this to ensure authorization and authentication for accessing the calculator's data.
- We use the `acquires` keyword to indicate that this function will acquire the `Calculator` resource during its execution. This ensures exclusive access to the `Calculator` resource while the function is running, preventing potential data corruption.
- We use the `borrow_global()` function to get an immutable reference to our `Calculator` resource associated with the account.
- We retrieve and return the `result` field from the `Calculator`.

Alright! Itâ€™s time to dive into the main action, starting with the `add()` function. This nifty little function will take two numbers (operands) and return their sum. Now, since we havenâ€™t covered operators yet, weâ€™ll get a bit creative and set the value of `result` to a string for now. Oh, and donâ€™t miss the little tweak: weâ€™ve changed the datatype of `result` to `vector<u8>` to store those fancy strings.

```
fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
    let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
    calculator.result = b"I am addition function";

    get_result(account);
}
```

Letâ€™s break down this function definition a bit : 

- We're creating a function named `add` using the `fun` keyword.
- This function takes three parameters:
    1. `account`: A parameter of type `&signer` to represent the account performing the operation.
    2. `num1`: A `u64` parameter that represents our first operand.
    3. `num2`: A `u64` parameter that represents our second operand.
- The `acquires` keyword indicates that this function will acquire the `Calculator` resource during its execution. This ensures that no other function can modify the `Calculator` resource concurrently, preventing potential data corruption.
- We use the `borrow_global_mut()` function to get a mutable reference to our `Calculator` resource associated with the account so that we can modify the `result` field.
- We then set the value of `result` to a constant string value: "I am addition function".
- Finally, we call the `get_result()` function to return the value of `result`.

Now, letâ€™s keep the momentum going by following the same pattern and creating functions for the remaining operations. Each function will set the result to a string based on the operation we want to perform. The final code should look somewhat like this.

```
module metaschool::calculator_l12 {
    use std::signer;

    struct Calculator has key {
        result: vector<u8>,  // Result will be of type string 
    }

    fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            calculator.result = b"";  
        }
        else {
            let calculator = Calculator { result: b"" };
            move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }

   fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am addition function";

        get_result(account);
    }

   fun subtract(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am subtraction function";

        get_result(account);
    }

	fun multiply(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am multiplication function";

        get_result(account);
    }

  fun divide(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am division function";

        get_result(account);
    }

  fun power(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am power function";

        get_result(account);
    }

  fun get_result(account: &signer): vector<u8> acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result
    }
}

```

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Functions are the building blocks of any programming language and is the key to writing efficient and organized code. Next up, weâ€™ll dive into Visibility specifiers for functions, which give us the power to control where our functions can be accessed from. Because, letâ€™s face it, if you try interacting with the dApp in its current state, your frontend will be left hanging. Stay tuned, and letâ€™s figure out how to fix this in the next lesson!ðŸ‘‹
