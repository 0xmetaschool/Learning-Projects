# Enrich Your dApp Using Data Types

Hey there, welcome back! In the last lesson, you learned all about declaring and initializing the variables and constants. Now, we need to learn the data types available in Aptos Move. So that we know the different types of data types we can use in our `calculator` dApp.

In the World of programming, Data reigns supreme. It's the fuel that powers our creations, allowing us to mold, shape, and bring ideas to life. Now, imagine a language where the possibilities for data manipulation are boundless. That's exactly what MOVE offers.

 Whether you're storing a simple word, a complex paragraph, a colossal number, or even a crucial address, MOVE's arsenal of data types equips you with the tools to harness data in its various forms.

To get started,  it's essential to understand their fundamental classification. Data types can be neatly categorized into two distinct groups:

> primitive and non-primitive data types.
> 

The term 'primitive' refers to the basic building blocks of data types that the programming language directly supports. Think of them as the foundation of a house. Examples of primitive data types include unsigned integers (like whole numbers), booleans (true or false values), and addresses (unique identifiers).

On the other hand, 'non-primitive' data types are like the rooms and furniture you build on top of that foundation. They are created by the programmer using primitive data types. Examples of non-primitive data types include vectors (which are like lists) and strings (which are sequences of characters).

Here's a simple example to make it clearer:

- **Primitive data type:** Imagine an unsigned integer as a single Lego brick. It's basic and can be used on its own.
- **Non-primitive data type:** Now, imagine a vector as a structure made from several Lego bricks. It's more complex and built using the basic bricks.

So, primitive data types are the essential elements, while non-primitive data types are more complex structures built from these essentials.

We’ll start with the Primitive data types and work our way around to Non-primitive data types. 

## Unsigned Integers

Let’s kick off primitive datatypes starting with storing numbers. In Move, we have the unsigned integers specifically designed for storing numerical values. This type is perfect for storing whole numbers without decimal places.

![numbers-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](2%20Enrich%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Data%20Types%20488c196c083d42069767cb4a234f5279/numbers-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

We have `u8`, `u16`,`u32`,`u64`,`u128` and `u256` each with its specific range of values it can hold. the number following the letter ‘u’ represents the number of bits available for storage. Remember Higher the bits, the larger the value that can be stored.

1. `u8`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^8 - 1 || which equals 0 - 255.
2. `u16`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^16 - 1 || which equals 0 - 65535
3. `u32`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^32 - 1.
4. `u64`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^64 - 1.
5. `u128`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^128 - 1.
6. `u256`: This type can store numbers from 0 to 2^256 - 1.

Okay, I know that’s a lot to memorize but don’t worry we will help you understand the application of these data types! With that excitement, let’s quickly see an example. 

```
module metaschool::unsigned_integers
{
    use std::debug as bug;
    
    fun sample_function(){
        let myU8: u8;
        myU8 = 200;
        bug::print(&myU8);
    }
}
```

Here, we have an unsigned integer `u8` variable. The '`8`' in `u8` represents the number of bits available for storage. With 8 bits, the largest value we can store is 2 to the power of 8, which equals 256. However, since we start counting from 0, the largest value we can store in `u8` is 255.

Now what if we store a value greater than 255?

```
 fun sample_function(){
        let myU8: u8;
        myU8 = 300;
    }
```

Here, we are storing a larger value such as 300, in the `myU8` variable. In this case, MOVE's type system steps in to ensure data integrity. It recognizes that 300 exceeds the allowable range for U8 and prevents the assignment, throwing a compilation error.

## Boolean

Next up, we have Boolean. Now, the legendary William Shakespeare once said “to be or not to be”, he unknowingly captured the essence of the boolean data type. This data type represents a binary value of either true or false. 

![bulb.gif](2%20Enrich%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Data%20Types%20488c196c083d42069767cb4a234f5279/bulb.gif)

It's like a switch for a light bulb that can only be on or off, making it one of the simplest yet powerful data types in programming.

```
 fun sample_function(){
       let myBool: bool;
        myBool = true;
        myBool = false;
    }
```

Here, we have declared a Boolean variable called `myBool` using the `let` keyword and specifying the data type with the `bool` keyword. We are then assigning `true` to `myBool`, indicating a positive state. Next, we assign false to `myBool`, representing a negative state. Just like flipping a light switch, Booleans in Move offers a straightforward way to represent binary decisions or states within our programs.

## Addresses

Now, let's talk about the next data type, which is somewhat similar to the address of your home. 

![address-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](2%20Enrich%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Data%20Types%20488c196c083d42069767cb4a234f5279/address-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

In the world of blockchain, think of blockchain as the society you live in, where each entity has its unique address, just like your home has a specific address in your neighborhood. It's like having a digital GPS that guides us to specific destinations within the blockchain network.

```
 fun sample_function(){
      	let myAddress: address;
        myAddress = 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f;
        myAddress = @0x2; // same as 0x00000000000000000000000000000002
    }
```

Here, we declare an address variable called `myAddress` using the `let` keyword, specifying the data type using the `address` keyword. We then assign the address as the value to this particular variable, representing a digital location on the blockchain. This address acts as our digital coordinates, allowing us to interact with specific entities like contracts or user accounts within the blockchain ecosystem.

Let’s overwrite the value of `myAddress` with `@0x2`, which is equivalent to `0x00000000000000000000000000000002`. This shows how we can assign values to an address variable in Move, including using hexadecimal notation for addresses.

The address data type is really important in blockchain development, serving as a key tool for accurate communication and transaction handling between different entities.

## Vectors

Remember how the chicks follow a line and move in the form of an array when moving behind their mama? This somehow shows the essence of staying true to their group and never abandoning it. That is how the essence of vectors works. This means the data of the same data types should remain intact which can help form one array instead of creating multiple variables.

![ducklings-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](2%20Enrich%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Data%20Types%20488c196c083d42069767cb4a234f5279/ducklings-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

Imagine a scenario where you need to handle a collection of 15 unsigned integers. One way to approach this is by creating 15 separate unsigned integer variables, which can be tedious and cumbersome to manage. This approach not only consumes time but also requires keeping track of numerous variables.

This is where Vectors come in handy. Vectors are special because they're the only basic way to collect a bunch of the same type of things. 

A few important things to remember about Vectors is that it is a Homogenous Collection, meaning that it will only store data of the same type. For example, if you create a vector of type `u8` then it will only store values of that particular type, making them efficient and easy to work with. It is also able to grow or shrink dynamically in size so that you can store as many values as needed.

You can create a vector using the `vector` literal. First, let’s import the vector module into our module and simply use the `vector` keyword followed by the desired data type. 

```
module metaschool::vector_example
{
    use std::vector;

    fun sample_function(){
      let v1:vector<u64> = vector<u64>[];
    }
}
```

This creates a mutable Variable `v1` of type vector`<u64>` without any values inside. But what if you want to initialize the Vector during declaration? 

```
    fun sample_function(){
      let v1:vector<u64> = vector<u64> [10,20,30];
      bug::print(&v1);
    }
```

All you need to do is specify all the values to be present within the vector `v1` inside of `[]` separated by commas.

If you wanna modify the Vector, as in maybe insert or remove values from it then, in that case, we have a bunch of functions that can be used from the `std::vector` module, for example, `empty()`, `push_back(v: &mut vector<T>, t: T)`, `swap<T>(v: &mut vector<T>, i: u64, j: u64)`, etc.

## Strings

Well, Let’s say you wanna store your name or a random sentence, OK so which data type should we go for? the data we are trying to store is a sequence of characters called a String and this is kinda of where things get interesting. Move doesn't have a native type specifically for handling strings like some other languages do. You might be wondering, "What's up with that?”

Think of it like this: Imagine you're trying to store your favorite song lyrics in a tiny box. But oh no, the box is too small to fit all the words in! That's kind of how Move feels about strings – it's all about being efficient and focused on blockchain tasks, so it doesn't have a dedicated space for long chunks of text.

![music-box-ezgif.com-optimize.gif](2%20Enrich%20Your%20dApp%20Using%20Data%20Types%20488c196c083d42069767cb4a234f5279/music-box-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

But fear not! We have two tricks up our sleeve to work with strings in Move:

### Using the `string` Module

It's like bringing in a magic toolbox that can handle strings effortlessly. You can import the `string` module and use the `String` type along with the `utf8` function to create and manipulate strings. For example:

```
use std::string::{String, utf8};

fun greeting(): String {
    let greet: String = utf8(b"Welcome to Move Programming!");
    return greet;
}
```

### Using `vector<u8>` for Byte Strings

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, you can think of strings as a series of bytes, like a secret code where each letter is represented by a number. You can use the vector<u8> type to store byte strings. For example:

```
let byte_string: vector<u8> = b"Hello, world!";
```

## Let’s understand where we used data types in the `calculator`

We have already used some data types in our calculator dApp. Let’s see where we used them.

```
module metaschool::calculator {

		// Rsource with key ability
    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

    fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
        
		        // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            
            calculator.result = 0;
        }
        else {
        
	        // Defining calculator variable using let keyword
	        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
	        
	        move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }
}
```

In our calculator contract, we defined the `result` field of type `u64`. For now we are using only one data type in our `calculator` module. 

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we covered various examples. Try running using the Move CLI. Here's what you can do: create a new package named `examples` and then create different modules such as `integers`, `strings`, `vectors`, and `addresses`. 

Integers, boolean values, strings, vectors, and addresses are the primary data types that you will use frequently when using Move. These data types will assist you in constructing the foundations and beginning to program your first application. Following that, we will delve into the different operators and how we can perform different tasks in the Move programming language.
