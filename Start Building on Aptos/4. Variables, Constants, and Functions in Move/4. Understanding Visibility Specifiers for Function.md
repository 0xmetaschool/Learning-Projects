# Understanding Visibility Specifiers for Functions

As developers, we're the architects shaping the operations within our blockchain applications. However, just like a master architect designing a complex structure, we must carefully decide who can access specific functions.

All of the functions we had created in the previous lesson like `add()` , `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`, `power()`, and `get_result()` are currently private by default. That’s just how it works in Aptos Move, unless we explicitly specify the visibility of a function they will stay private , meaning they can’t be accessed outside of our module. so we need to make our front-end 📱to be able to summon these functions.

To address this, Move provides us with visibility specifiers— a tool to precisely control where functions can be executed and who has the authority to call them.

## Private visibility

By default, functions are private, meaning they can only be accessed by other functions within the same module. It’s like a locker in a bank, which can be accessed only by the person who owns it.  Let me show you an example:

```
module maths::multiplication {
    fun return(): u64 {
        42;
    }
}

module maths::call {
		use maths::multiplication;
		
    fun call_maths_package(): u64 {
        maths::multiplication::return(); // ERROR
    }
}
```

Here, the `return` function is private by default, so it's like a private room that only the `multiplication` module can access. Here’s a diagram for you to understand this better.

![Group 15.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Understanding%20Visibility%20Specifiers%20for%20Function/Group_15.webp?raw=true)

Notably, functions within a module are set as private by default. This helps to keep code organized and maintainable. You don't need to use a specific keyword to declare them as private, which can save time when writing code.

## Public visibility

You can use the `public` keyword to make a function public. Public functions are accessible from outside the module, meaning other modules can call these functions. Let me add a public function to our last example:

```
module maths::multiplication {
		public fun multiply(value: u64): u64 {
        value * 2;
    }
}
```

By putting the `public` keyword before the `fun` keyword, we've made the `multiply` function public. Isn't that so easy?

Keep in mind that the following entities can call public functions:

1. other functions declared in the same module
2. functions defined in another module
3. the functions defined in the script

Let’s look at a complete example to understand the above points.

```
module maths::multiplication {
		public fun multiply(value: u64): u64 {
        value * 2;
    }
    
    fun return(): u64 {
        42;
    }
}

module maths::addition {
		public fun add(value: u64): u64 {
				let res : u64 = maths::multiplication::multiply(value);
        res + value + 2;
    }
}

module maths::call {
		use maths::multiplication;
		use maths::addition;
		
    fun call_maths_package(value: u64): u64 {
        maths::multiplication::multiply(value); // VALID
        maths::addition::add(value); // VALID
        maths::multiplication::return(); // ERROR
    }
}
```

Here, the `multiplication` module has a `public multiply` function, and the `addition` module has a `public add` function that calls the `multiply` function from the `multiplication` module. Similarly, the `call` module calls both `multiply` and `add` functions. Here’s a diagram for you to understand this better.

## Public(friend) visibility

The `public(friend)` modifier is a bit more of a restricted form of the public visibility modifier. This helps increase the security of the functions and control where the functions can be used. Let's see where `public(friend)` functions can be called:

1. other functions inside of the same module
2. functions defined in modules that are explicitly specified using the friend keyword.

Let’s look at the detailed example.

```
module maths::multiplication {
		friend maths::addition; // friend declaration
		
		public(friend) fun multiply(value: u64): u64 {
        value * 2;
    }
    
    fun call_addition(value: u64): u64 {
	    maths::addition::add(value); // VALID
    }
}

module maths::addition {
		public fun add(value: u64): u64 {
				let res : u64 = maths::multiplication::multiply(value); // VALID
        res + value + 2;
    }
}

module maths::subtraction {
		public fun sub(value: u64): u64 {
				/* The following line will throw an error as the subtraction module is not
				   a friend of the multiplication module. */
				let res : u64 = maths::multiplication::multiply(value); // ERROR
        value - 2;
    }
}

module maths::call {
		use maths::multiplication;
		use maths::addition;
		
    fun calls_maths_package(value: u64): u64 {
        maths::multiplication::multiply(value); // ERROR
        maths::addition::add(value); // VALID
    }
}
```

Let’s understand the code in detail.

1. Inside the `multiplication` module, we imported the `addition` module using the `friend` keyword and called the add function inside of the `call_addition` function, which is a valid call.
2. Inside the `addition` module, we are calling the `multiply` function which is a valid call because we imported the `addition` module inside of the `multiplication` module using the `friend` keyword. This means the `multiplication` module can call the `addition` module functions and the `addition` module can call the `multiplication` module functions.
3. Thirdly, we defined the `subtraction` module which tries to call the `multiplication` module. Here, the code will throw an error because the `subtraction` module is not a friend of the `multiplication` module.
4. Lastly, we are defining a `call` module that again tries to call the `multiplication` module. We will face an error again here as the `call` module is not a friend of the `multiplication` module.

Here’s the diagram to understand this better.

## Entry functions

Alright people, listen in and heed my words. This is a really important concept you need to be aware of when it comes to Move, so, buckle up! There is a special type of function in Move which serves as the entry point for external entities like users, other smart contracts, or even off-chain applications to interact with the blockchain. 

These functions are designated as entry points because they are accessible from outside the blockchain network, allowing external users or other smart contracts to invoke and interact with the functionality provided by the Move code.

In Move, one of the basic operations is transferring gas objects between addresses representing individual users. When you make a transaction, the `entry` function is called directly. It's like the main entrance to a party! To create an `entry` function, we need to follow these three rules.

1. The function should be marked by the `entry` keyword.
2. It should have no return value.
3. It is compulsory to pass the `&signer` as an argument to the entry functions.

Let me show you an example from our first contract program:

```
module hello_world::msg {
    use std::signer;

    struct Message has key {
        value: vector<u8>
    }

    public entry fun set_message(account: &mut signer, msg: vector<u8>) {
        move_to(&account, Message { value: msg });
    }
}
```

In this example, the `set_message` function is an entry function marked with the `entry` keyword. It takes a `&mut signer` as the last parameter, which identifies the caller who wants to store a message. The function has no return value, and it uses `move_to` to store a `Message` object containing the provided `msg` vector under the caller's account in global storage.

This is a simple example of an entry function that allows users to store a message on the blockchain. Pretty cool, right? Entry functions are like the party entrance, allowing users to interact with your Move module and make transactions.

**Note:** Adding `&` with the function input means we are passing the argument by reference, meaning the variable refers to the memory address of the original value. And adding `&mut` with the variable means you can change the value of the memory address the variables refer to.

## Entry functions vs Public functions

So, what's the difference between entry functions and public functions? Well, public functions can be called from other modules, but they don't necessarily interact with the blockchain or make transactions. Entry functions, on the other hand, are specifically designed to be called when making a transaction on the blockchain.

Entry functions require special `&mut signer` parameters to identify the caller and allow them to make changes to the blockchain state. Public functions don't have this requirement and can be called from other modules for various purposes, such as performing computations or accessing data.

## Making our code Functionally Accessible

Time to make our functions accessible by granting them the necessary permissions. Our goal is to enable our React frontend app to call these functions from outside the Aptos blockchain, allowing access from anyone, anywhere.

We will be making all the function to be both `public`and `entry` function except the`get_result()` function which doesn’t need to called from our frontend, so we will be keeping the `get_result()` just `public`. This is how the final code will look like.

```
module metaschool::calculator_l12 {
    use std::signer;

    struct Calculator has key {
        result: vector<u8>,  // Result will be of type string 
    }

    public entry fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            calculator.result = b"";  
        }
        else {
            let calculator = Calculator { result: b"" };
            move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }

    public entry fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am addition function";

        get_result(account);
    }

     public entry fun subtract(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am subtraction function";

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun multiply(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am multiplication function";

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun divide(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am division function";

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun power(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = b"I am power function";

        get_result(account);
    }

    public fun get_result(account: &signer): vector<u8> acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result
    }
}
```

Let’s get this code published to the Network. So much like last time, we need to setup our Aptos CLI first and then publish our code. But first, let's quickly swap out our boilerplate with the corresponding frontend for these functionalities. 

```
git checkout origin/boilerplate_03
```

1. In the `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` directory, run the following command: 
    ```
    aptos init
    ```   
2. Skip this step if your wallet is already configured. Type in “testnet” for your network and provide your Private key when prompted. 
3. Edit the `Move.toml` file by adding your Wallet address against `metaschool`:
    ```
    metaschool = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
    ```
4. Paste the complete code in `sources/calculator.move`.
5. Compile the code using the following command:   
    ```
    aptos move compile --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
    ```
6.  Now, deploy the code using the following command:  
    ```
    aptos move publish --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
    ```
    

## Let’s smash some more buttons

Let’s try out our current dApp using the frontend:

1. Change the directory to the `interface` folder:
    
    ```
    cd ./interface
    ```
    
2. With the terminal still in the `interface` directory, install all the necessary dependencies by running:
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    

You can ignore the warning generated in the terminal. Once done you should be able to find a `.env` file in your `interface` folder and it would look something like this:

```
REACT_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
REACT_APP_MODULE_NAME= "calculator_l12"
```

Replace your Petra wallet address with `<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>`. And now we are all set, Finally set sail and deploy our react App by running.

```
npm start
```

Here’s how the dApp will look in your browser. Turn on the calculator and try some algebraic operations. While it won't crunch any numbers just yet, it will greet you with a message based on the operation you've performed😉.

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` folder. If you are in `interface` folder just run `cd ../` to return to the previous directory. Push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 
```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## That's a wrap

Function visibility and entry functions play a crucial role in Move. Now, Let’s dive deeper into Move and learn about friends as we mentioned in this lesson. It's time for us to explore a whole new dimension of awesomeness, my friend!
