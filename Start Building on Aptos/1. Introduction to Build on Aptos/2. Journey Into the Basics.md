# Journey Into the Basics

Alrighty, folks! Buckle up because we‚Äôre laying the groundwork for our adventure into the world of blockchain magic! üåü In this lesson, we‚Äôre diving deep into the basics of blockchain, and smart contracts, and getting a sneak peek into the awesome world of the Move language. Get ready to build your knowledge from the ground up!

## WTH is blockchain?

Alright, let‚Äôs dive into the legendary tale of banks‚Äîthe classic example that unveils the wonders of blockchain to all newbies stepping into the realm of web3 magic! üí´ Picture this: You trust the bank with your hard-earned cash, believing they'll keep it safe and let you access it whenever you need it. But what if the bank suddenly decides to play hide-and-seek with your money? Sounds scary, right? Well, in the centralized world of banking, it's a risk we take.


But fear not, brave souls! Here‚Äôs where our hero swoops in with a cape and a drumroll... ü•Å Enter Blockchain!

So, what's the deal with blockchain? You might've heard it's a decentralized digital ledger, but let‚Äôs unravel that lingo! Imagine traditional banks as notebooks guarded by a single master. Only they can write or tweak what's inside. Now, shift gears to blockchain‚Äîit's like a treasure trove of notebooks, each guarded by a squad of guardians. They can peek inside, and verify, but no one holds the ultimate power. It‚Äôs like a team effort where everyone has a say!

But wait, there's more! Blockchain boasts immutability‚Äîonce it's on the ledger, it's there to stay, no tampering allowed! Plus, it flaunts transparency, meaning you can peek into transactions whenever you want. It's like the ultimate truth-teller of the digital world!

## WTH are Smart Contracts?

Alright, now that we've dipped our toes into the magical waters of blockchain, let's dive a little deeper, shall we? We've all heard of the blockchain power duo‚ÄîBitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin paved the way for blockchain as a decentralized currency exchange, but then along came Ethereum with a game-changer: Smart Contracts!

Imagine this: You write a piece of code, pop it onto the blockchain, and bam! It becomes an unstoppable force, executing itself when certain conditions are met. That's the beauty of a Smart Contract‚Äîit's like magic, but for real! ‚ú® And guess what? One of the VIP languages for these contracts is called Solidity.

Now, you might be thinking, "Hold on a sec, weren't we supposed to be talking about Move programming language?" You're absolutely right! Move is our shining knight in blockchain armor! While Solidity has had its fair share of uh-oh moments with hacks, Move swoops in with a promise of security and safety. So, buckle up, because we're about to take a whirlwind tour of Move‚Äîyour new favorite programming language!

## Into the world of Move programming language

Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of Move‚Äîyour ticket to building secure, reliable, and downright awesome smart contracts!

### Key features of Move

- **Safety First:** Move prioritizes safety by employing static typing and a resource-oriented approach. This ensures memory safety and prevents common vulnerabilities in smart contract code.
- **Focus on Resources:** Move treats digital assets (like currency) as special resource types. This allows for strict control over ownership and transfer of these assets on the blockchain.
- **Bytecode Language:** Move compiles to bytecode, which is directly executed by the blockchain. This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and security.
- **Modular Design:** Move uses modules to promote code reusability and improve code organization for complex smart contracts.

## That‚Äôs a wrap

Whew! We've got the basics down pat, and now it's time to crank up the excitement even more! üöÄ In our next lesson, get ready to dive deeper into the awesome world of Move language and discover why it's the ultimate choice for crafting jaw-dropping dApps. Can't wait to see you there!
