# What Are We Building Today?

GM everyone! ☀️ We’re super excited to kick off the second course in our detailed series on Aptos for developers here on Metaschool. First things first, let’s give you a big round of applause for completing the [first course on Aptos](https://metaschool.so/courses/introduction-to-aptos-chainn). Woohoo! 🎉

Did you know? Engaging with blockchain projects on GitHub can lead to unexpected perks. Aptos, like many others, often rewards its most active followers. Consider following [their repo](https://github.com/aptos-labs) to stay in the loop!

Aptos is a powerhouse layer-1 blockchain with nearly $400 million in funding and a market cap approaching $4 billion. With daily transactions averaging 500K, Aptos is the place to be! We're thrilled to help you build on this platform and bring your dApp ideas to life, with the chance to win grants for innovative projects. It's time to put your ideas to the test—literally!

We have already talked about features like the Resource-oriented structure, Block STM, Aptos Standards, and the Move programming language in our first course. Instead of long-winded articles, we’re going hands-on this time—because the best way to learn is to get building, right? This course ensures you pick up practical skills and confidence, starting with a basic calculator dApp. As you progress, you’ll learn new concepts and add more functionalities to your dApp.

## The Calculator dApp

But why build a calculator dApp, you ask? Buckle up, because this isn't just about crunching numbers! This seemingly simple app serves as a powerful launchpad for your blockchain development journey. Here's why:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Building a calculator dApp is an engaging and practical way to grasp Aptos blockchain concepts like **smart contracts**, which are self-executing programs that power dApps.
- **Move Fundamentals:** You'll delve into **Move on Aptos**, the programming language specifically designed for creating smart contracts on Aptos. By building the calculator, you'll gain a strong foundation in Move on Aptos syntax and functionality.
- **Deployment and Interaction:** The excitement doesn't stop at coding! You'll deploy your calculator dApp onto a blockchain, allowing you to interact with it and see your code come to life in a decentralized environment.

You can try it out yourself [here](https://calculator-d-app.vercel.app/).

### Features of dApp

This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build the **core functionalities** of a calculator dApp:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** You'll master adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers using smart contracts.
- **Advanced Features:** We'll explore functions like calculating powers, performing modulo operations (finding remainders), and implementing logical and comparison operations for a versatile calculator.
