# Why use Move to Build dApps

Welcome back! üåü There‚Äôs a quote that goes, ‚ÄúIf you just communicate, you can get by. But if you communicate skillfully, you can work miracles.‚Äù To build our dApp, we need to be able to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the Aptos Blockchain to store data and perform the necessary operations required for our Calculator to work some magic.

Just like how we‚Äôre using English, a spoken language, to communicate with you right now, we will use a programming language called Aptos Move to communicate with the Aptos Blockchain.

## Move it or Lose it: Why Move?

We had already talked about Move in brief in the previous lesson but let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper and understand the motivation behind the creation of Move and the purposes it serves.

Born from Facebook's Diem project and based on the Rust programming language, Move is adaptable and perfect for building dApps. Aptos Labs adopted Move and optimized it for their blockchain, focusing on dialects and functionalities specific to the Aptos environment. Despite these optimizations, Aptos Move remains highly similar to core Move (around 70-80%), making the transition smooth for existing Move developers.

## What was the need for Move?

In one word: Security. Since 2020, the web3 ecosystem has lost nearly $8 billion to hacks and attacks. Move is designed to prevent common security flaws like reentrancy attacks and integer overflows, which are prevalent in other smart contract languages.

## Making dApps Move: Secure & Reliable by Design

When building decentralized apps (dApps), security and reliability are crucial. No one wants their app to be hacked or lose trust because of bugs. Aptos Move helps prevent these issues through several key features.

### 1. Resource-centric Design

Smart contracts handle digital assets on the blockchain. Move takes a different approach, focusing on the assets themselves with a resource-based design. This means your assets are stored directly in your account, giving you complete control. Unlike Solidity, where smart contracts act as middlemen between you and your assets, Move ensures you own the assets directly.

### 2. Enforced Scarcity

Move enforces scarcity on resources, meaning you can control the number of resources created and prevent accidental creation or duplication. This is crucial for maintaining the value of assets, just like how the rarity of a coin is preserved by limiting its quantity.

### 3. Granular Access Control

Move allows precise control over who can interact with and modify resources within a smart contract. Similar to how you might give different levels of access to people handling your coin collection, Move lets you specify who can do what with your resources.

### 4. Formal Verification

Move includes a tool called the Move Prover, which checks if your smart contract works according to specified rules. This is like an in-built testing feature that ensures the safety and security of your contract by verifying its behavior.

## That's a wrap

To sum up, we explored how Aptos Move enhances dApp development with its focus on security, verifiability, and resource management. We saw how it prevents common security issues, keeps digital assets at the forefront, enforces scarcity, allows granular access control, and includes tools for formal verification. In the next lesson, we‚Äôll get hands-on by setting up the Aptos SDK to start building our calculator dApp on the Aptos blockchain. See you soon.
