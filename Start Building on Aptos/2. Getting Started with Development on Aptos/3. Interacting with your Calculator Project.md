# Interacting with your Calculator Project

Hey, buddy! Kudos on creating your Calculator project and mastering the basics of the Move package structure. What’s next? Well, the lesson title gives it away but let me reiterate. Yep, we're going to "add" our Calculator dApp to the Aptos blockchain and "subtract" any doubts by interacting with it! Sounds exciting, right? So, let’s not "divide" our attention any longer and dive right in!

## Quick Code Drop

Now navigate to `sources/calculator.move` and we have the following code there:

```
module metaschool::calculator_l05
{
    use std::string::{String,utf8};
    use std::signer;

    struct Message has key
    {
        my_message : String
    }

    public entry fun create_message(account: &signer) acquires Message {
        
        let my_message = utf8(b"I am a Calculator dApp");

        if (exists<Message>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let message = borrow_global_mut<Message>(signer::address_of(account));
            message.my_message = my_message;
        }
        else {
            let message = Message {
                my_message : my_message            
            };
            move_to(account,message);    
        }
    }

    public fun get_message(account: &signer): String acquires Message {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Message>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.my_message
    }
}
```

A bit too much, All of a sudden? No need to fret. By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to handle much more than what meets the eye now. To give you a glimpse into our code's functionality:

- `create_message()`: This function stores a default message ("I am a Calculator Dapp") on the blockchain if it's not already there.
- `get_message()`: It retrieves and returns the stored message from the blockchain.

Despite its name, this particular Calculator dApp won't crunch any numbers just yet. Instead, it politely announces its existence with the message *"I am a Calculator Dapp."* But fear not, we'll gradually build our calculator with all its glorious functionalities throughout the upcoming lessons.

Let’s compile the code using the following command:

```
aptos move compile
```

Now, deploy the code using the following command:

```
aptos move publish --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
```

Type “yes” when the command asks if you want to pay for the transaction. And kudos, you have deployed the code successfully. This is a snippet of a successful deployment.

## Let’s smash some buttons

Well, yes now it’s time to see what our calculator dApp looks like from frontend. 

1. Open your terminal and change the directory to the `interface` folder using the following command:
    
    ```
    cd ./interface
    ```
    
2. With the terminal still in the `interface` directory, install all the necessary dependencies by running:
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    

You can ignore the warning generated in the terminal. Once done you should be able to find a `.env` file in your `interface` folder and it would look something like this:

```
REACT_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
REACT_APP_MODULE_NAME= "calculator_l05"
```

Replace your Petra wallet address with `<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>`. And now we are all set, so let’s run the dApp using the following command, wohooo:

```
npm start
```

Well, this is how the dApp will look like in your browser, try clicking the turn-on button to fetch the message from our Smart Contract.

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` folder. If you are in `interface` folder just run `cd ../` to return to the previous directory. Push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 
```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## That's a wrap

Woohoo! High-fives all around! We’ve officially launched our code into the digital cosmos! 🚀 Now, we’re like digital astronauts ready for our next cosmic adventure. In our next lesson, prepare to decode the secrets of Move program structures. It’s like unraveling the map to hidden treasure—you’ll navigate our Calculator DApp like a seasoned explorer!
