# Set Up the Environment Wizard

Hey there, welcome back! You've been crushing it so far, grasping why Move is so incredible! Now, it's time to take the next step and set up our development environment with all the necessary dependencies.

You might be wondering, "Why do we need to do all this?" Well, to build our dApp, we need the right tools in place. This will allow us to code, run, deploy, and ultimately interact with our creation. So, let’s dive into this lesson, get everything set up, and get ready to build our awesome dApp!

## Understanding dev wizard

Alright, now that we've nailed down the basics of smart contracts and blockchains, let's dive into where all the magic happens—the development environment! Think of it as your personal coding workshop, filled with the essential tools needed to bring your software creations to life. For our project, the Calculator dApp, there are a couple of must-have tools: a code editor and a compiler.

![image52.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/image52.webp?raw=true)

The code editor helps you organize your code, while the compiler converts your code into bytecode—a special language that your computer, or more specifically, the blockchain, can understand. So, let's get these tools set up! We'll be installing:

- [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and code editor that will make your coding experience a breeze.
- [**Move Analyzer**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer): This extension provides essential language support for the Move programming language. While it's technically optional, we highly recommend installing it to enhance your coding experience.

We'll also be building a front-end for our dApp, so you'll need a couple more tools on your system. Make sure to install the following:

- [**Git**](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads): Essential for version control and managing your codebase.
- [**Node and npm**](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm): Vital for running JavaScript code and managing packages.
- **Git CLI:** It allows you to connect with git via the terminal, so let’s install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, and type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git. You might need to enter your GitHub password if you have yet to log in.

Get these installed, and you'll be all set to create an awesome front-end for our Calculator dApp!

## Environments in the blockchain network

Alright, buckle up for a little journey into a crucial concept when diving into the blockchain world—exploring the different environments where the magic happens! Aptos blockchain offers a buffet of options: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.

- **Devnet**: Your local playground for lightning-fast testing & development.
- **Testnet**: It's like a mirror of the mainnet, perfect for realistic testing. Plus, it hands out "play" tokens, so you can deploy and test your code without spending real dough. Just hit up the faucet to get your hands on these tokens for free!
- **Mainnet**: The real deal. It's where the big leagues play, with actual tokens and real-world impact. So tread carefully, my friend.

## Setup Petra Wallet

In Web3, a wallet is your digital identity and key to the decentralized world. It lets you own and manage your assets, interact with dApps, and securely handle transactions. With so many options in the market to choose from, Petra Wallet stands out as the top dog. With its user-friendly interface, robust security features, and seamless integration with Aptos, Petra makes accessing and managing your assets a walk in the park. It's the paw-fect companion for your web3 adventures!

First, we will set the wallet use to build our dApp.

1. Download the [Petra Aptos Wallet Chrome extension](https://petra.app/).
2. Click the “Create New Wallet” button.
3. Create a password and securely store your recovery phrase, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

( Pin the Petra Aptos Wallet extension to your taskbar, coz we’ll be needing it quite often )

## Change the network

We will be deploying our code to the Testnet, so we need to change the network that our wallet is connected to. Follow the steps given below to change it:

1. Go to “Settings” which is at the bottom right corner.
2. Click on the “Network”.
3. Select “Testnet”.

And with this, we have successfully changed the network.

## Copy the essentials

There are two key essential pieces of information that you’ll require quite often for development and deployment.

1. Wallet Address
2. Private Key

Follow the steps given below to copy and save these:

1. Go to “Settings” which is at the bottom right corner.
2. Scroll down and go to “Manage account”.
3. Enter the password for your Petra wallet and click on Next.
4. Copy the wallet address and save it somewhere secure.
5. Click on “Show” under the Private key.
6. Copy the private key and save it somewhere secure.
- Make sure to NEVER SHARE the private key with anyone. This is very private info and if someone gets access to it, they can hack into your account easily. So stay careful and safe!

## Fund the wallet

Here we have another important step to do and that is to fund the wallet. We need money to deploy our code so let’s ask for some fake money. Aptos deals in APT coins.

Click on the “Faucet” button and you will get 1 APT. Well, I clicked it twice to get 2 APT 😇.

## Installation on System

I’ll tell you step-by-step installation for your operating system (OS) which might be Mac, Linux, or Windows. So, opt for the OS you are using, and follow the steps.

### Installation on Mac

![image14.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/image14.webp?raw=true)

1. First, you need a brew package. The brew allows you to install the packages on Apple easily. Open a terminal on your Mac and run the following command. It will ask for your laptop’s password, provide it, and continue with the installation.
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh>)"
    ```

2. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
    ```
    brew update
    brew install aptos
    ```

3. Now restart the terminal or open another terminal and run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
    ```
    aptos help
    ```

How easy was it~

> **Well, if you are a Mac user, the installation part is done, move to the next lesson.**

### Installation on Linux

![image38.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/image38.webp?raw=true)

Before starting, just a little heads up: The set of instructions that we’ll discuss are of Ubuntu-based systems and anyone using a different Linux distribution can use their native package managers to install the same dependencies.

Open the terminal and run the following command to install the package. It will ask for your laptop’s password so provide it.
```
sudo install apt-get
```

Aptos peeps suggest that the best and easiest way to install the Aptos CLI tool is through Python script. So let’s install it by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install python
```

It will install the latest version of the python. You need a 3.6+ version. You can verify it using `python --version`.

Next, you have to ensure that you can use Python in every terminal so to do that you add the path where Python is installed to an environment variable called PATH. The variable PATH instructs Linux to the directories where it can search for the packages.

So let’s add Python to your PATH:

- Run `which python`, it tells where python has been installed on the system i.e., it gives you the path, COPY IT!
- Now run the following command after replacing `/path/to/python` with the path you copied to add the python path to your variable:
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/python
    ```

### Install Aptos CLI
You can install Aptos CLI using either `curl` or `wget`. The choice is up to you to go whichever option you want to. I am listing down both for you:

**Using curl**
- Install `curl`:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```
- Install Aptos CLI using the following command:
    ```
    curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
    ```

**Using wget**
- OR You can use wget which is a tool to download the files from the internet from the terminal directly. You can install it first:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install wget
    ```
- Install Aptos CLI using the following command:
    ```
    wget -qO- "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3
    ```

### Verify installation
Restart the terminal or open another terminal and run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
```
aptos help
```

> **Awesome! You are good to go to the next lesson!**

### Installation on Windows

![image20.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Set%20Up%20the%20Environment%20Wizard/image20.webp?raw=true)

You can install the Aptos CLI using the python. So first install Python by following the steps given:

1. Visit the [Python website and download the package](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) according to your system architecture.
2. Check your Downloads folder to see the package.
3. Install the package and you’re set up for python.

Now follow the steps given below to install the CLI:

1. Open PowerShell using the Start Menu.
2. Run the following command:
    ```
    iwr "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" -useb | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | python3
    ```
3. The command’s output will show you a command to set the PATH variable, make sure to run it.
4. Run the following command to verify if the CLI is installed.
    ```
    aptos help
    ```

## That’s a wrap

Whew! We’ve conquered the installation phase, and now it’s time to dive into the fun stuff! Get ready because in the next lesson, we’re rolling up our sleeves to create a project for our Calculator dApp. Let’s bring those coding dreams to life!
