# Unleashing the Power of Move Program Structure

Hey there, champs! 🌟 We’re absolutely blown away by how effortlessly you've set up your development playground and even taken the plunge to launch your inaugural smart contract! 

Now, let's tackle the million-dollar question: What exactly is a smart contract? Picture it as a digital rulebook, jam-packed with codes and conditions, designed to operate flawlessly within a specific framework.

But hey, navigating this digital realm can sometimes feel like trekking through a jungle without a map! 😅 That’s why mastering the foundational structure of Move contracts is absolutely crucial before we venture deeper into the unknown.

Our journey begins with a gentle introduction to Move's heart and soul: Modules!  But before we dive headfirst into these modules, let's pinpoint their place in the vast Move universe. Trust us, once we’ve decoded the mysteries of storage, the rest will unfold like pure magic! 

## Global storage

Welcome to Move World, where global storage rules! It's like a giant digital treasure chest, holding all the precious data ready to be discovered!

You see, in the vast expanse of the blockchain, data must stand the test of time—it's all about persistence, baby! We're talking about data that's so resilient, it never says goodbye and remains steadfast across every corner of the digital universe. So, whenever anyone needs a quick data fix, it's right there at their fingertips, ready to be unleashed!

Now, let's get to the exciting part—how does all this tie back to Move programs? 🚀 Let's uncover the magic together!

## Modules in the Move programming language

Think of Modules like magic libraries full of powerful tools that make coding fun!

So, what's inside these Modules? Well, they've got Struct types, which are like special containers that hold important info. And then there are functions, which are like little helpers that do all sorts of awesome stuff!

Modules are like treasure chests stored in a special place where everyone can access them. And the best part? We can use these Modules again and again in different parts of our code! It's like having a superpower that lets us build amazing things without doing the same work over and over again.

### Coding structure

Let’s straight away dive into the coding structure of a module in the Move programming language just like we went through the script coding structure. So in our calculator code, the first line of the smart contract was:

```
module metaschool::calculator {}
```

In Move, we declare a smart contract using the `module` keyword, just like we declare a smart contract in Solidity using the `contract` keyword. 

- The `metaschool` is the name we give our package at the time of package creation. Yes, we created a package named `metaschool` using the command `aptos move init --name metaschool`.
    - Instead of giving a package name, we can give the address of our package too, where the module will be stored in the global storage at the specified address. But that gets confusing, so it’s a common practice to go with the name of the package.
- The `calculator` that comes after `:` is the name of the module that we are creating in our package. There can be multiple modules in one package that’s why it's important to name each module separately. For example, if we add another module named `area_calculator` because it calculates the area of a specific shape, then we should name it differently for ease.

## Components in module

The module mainly contains the following components. The order of the components doesn’t matter. They can be written in any order, but to keep things organized, follow this order. 

1. `<import modules>`: A module can also import any other module. We can do it, but it wasn’t needed for our first code so we did not utilize it.
2. `<struct>`: In modules, you can create the structs to store data securely and efficiently. We will explore this more in the upcoming lessons.
3. `<functions>`: You can define multiple functions within a module and call them from any other module or script that imports the module.

In the following code, we imported two modules using the `use` keyword, created one struct, and created two functions that are used to print and set up the message.

```
module metaschool::calculator
{
		// <import modules>
    use std::string::{String,utf8};
    use std::signer;

		// <struct>
    struct Message has key
    {
        my_message : String
    }

		// <functions>
    public entry fun create_message(account: &signer)
    {
        if (!exists<Message>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let message = Message {
                my_message : utf8(b"I am a Calculator Dapp")            
            };
            move_to(account,message);    
        }
    }

    public fun get_message(account: &signer): String acquires Message {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Message>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.my_message
    }
}
```

- **Note:** The name of the module in Aptos should start with a small alphabet (`a`-`z`) and can contain an underscore (`_`), small alphabets (`a`-`z`), or digits(`0`-`9`) after the first letter. In short, the module name should be in `snake_case`. For example, `my_module123`, `account`, `my_module`, `module123`, etc, all are valid names.

Now that we know the basic way of creating a smart contract in Aptos Move. Let’s understand another important concept which is how to import one module into another. 

## Use keyword

The use keyword is used to import code from other modules or libraries into the current scope. In simpler terms, think of it like borrowing a book from a library. To borrow the book, You’ll need the “address” of the library and know which  “book” you want to borrow.

The syntax for using the `use` keyword is pretty simple.

```
use <Address/Alias>::<ModuleName>;
```

The `use` keyword is followed up by the `Address` of the module and the `Module` name of whichever component you want to import.

We used the following in our code:

```
use std::string::{String,utf8};
use std::signer;
```

- `std` represents the Move standard library, it’s a collection of really useful components that you can freely import and use within your code. We will see a bunch of these components later up in our lessons like `debug` module. We can print our message using the `print()` from the `debug` module in the code.
- Move does not support the native type for strings. But we can use it by including the `string` module.
- We will explore `signer` later in the upcoming lessons.

## That’s a wrap

Learning how to create contracts and use modules within each other is super important! Why, you ask? Because it helps make your code easy to understand and manage big projects without any fuss! Let's jump into this adventure together and explore the wonders of Move! 🌟
