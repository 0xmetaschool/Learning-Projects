# The Starting Line: Creating Your Calculator Project

Alright! We've set up our wallet and the Aptos-cli, and now it's time to start cooking up our calculator DApp. In this lesson, we'll guide you step-by-step on setting up your project so you can deploy your smart contract to the Aptos Network. Later, you'll learn how to interact with it using our pre-built frontend ðŸ˜‰. So let's get started!

## Setting the stage

We've got you covered with a GitHub repository, so you won't need to stress about building the frontend for the calculator. This means you can focus on the fun part: writing and deploying the smart contract on the Aptos Network. To keep things streamlined for all upcoming lessons, we've organized multiple branches. But since this is our first dive into the dApp, let's set things up from scratch and get the ball rolling!

The first thing we need to do is set up our Aptos CLI to work with the account we created in the previous lesson. We'll use the aptos init command inside a new folder that we will create.

1. Create and navigate to a new folder:

    ```markdown
    mkdir metaschool

    cd metaschool

    aptos init
    ```

2. When you run the above commands, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a network. Type testnet and press Enter.
2. Next, youâ€™ll be asked to provide the private key. Use the same private key you copied and saved from the previous lesson. Paste it into the terminal.

And voilÃ ! The Aptos CLI is successfully set up.

Next, run the following command to create a Move project:

```markdown
aptos move init --name calculator_l05
```

This command creates a Move package named calculator_l05. Feel free to name it whatever you like, but remember: you can't publish duplicate modules (modules with the same name) under a single address. So, choose wisely!

Next, create a file named `calculator.move` in the `sources` folder. These are the folders and files youâ€™ll have within the newly created directory:

Before moving on, letâ€™s understand the structure of the Move package.

## Move package: Unpacking the package

Just like Python uses .py files and Solidity uses .sol files, Move code files have a .move extension. Since Move focuses on building on the blockchain, we need a file to store all the deployment details and configurations. That's where the Move.toml file comes in handy!

The Move package is a folder that contains all the code files and the configuration file just like we have created one for Calculator dApp. Letâ€™s understand the Move package structure with an example of baking a cake that you need to deliver to someone:

- **Move Package**: Think of the Move package as a recipe book for baking a cake. It contains all the necessary instructions and ingredients to create a delicious cake from scratch.
- **Move Source Code Files (.move)**: These are like the individual steps or instructions within the recipe book. Each Move source code file represents a specific part of the baking process, such as mixing ingredients, baking the batter, and decorating the finished cake.
- **Move Configuration file (.toml):** These are like instructions to deliver the cake safely i.e. packing the cake into a box, providing the address where we want to deliver to, calling the rider, and finally delivering the cake successfully. So, the file contains information to deploy our code files to the specified blockchain.
- **Test Directory:** In addition to these, you can also have a test directory and a file to test out your code. Writing tests is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your code.

## What is Move.toml?

The `Move.toml` file is where all the important details about your package are stored, such as its name, version, and dependencies. But what does that mean for you? It means this file contains everything you need to deploy your code to the blockchain. Exciting, right?

Hereâ€™s a sample of `Move.toml` similar to the one that will be present in your project.

```markdown
[package]

name = "calculator_l05"

version = "1.0.0"

authors = []

[addresses]

[dev-addresses]

[dependencies.AptosFramework]

git = "<https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git>"

rev = "mainnet"

subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework"

[dev-dependencies]
```

The `Move.toml` has different sections, and each one has a specific job to do. Letâ€™s try to understand this file a bit more!

### **`[package]`**

This section is all about your package itself. It's where you declare the name and version of your project. Think of it as the title page of a book - it tells you what the story is about and who wrote it. Here the package name is `calculator_l05`.

### **`[dependencies]`**

Dependencies are like the supporting cast in your project's story. They are other packages or libraries that your project relies on to function smoothly.

### **`[addresses]`**

The `[addresses]` section allows you to assign aliases to addresses, making them easier to reference in your code. We give addresses to modules here and there can be multiple modules of one package. If you have seen wallet addresses before, you would know how complex they look.. wouldnâ€™t it be nice to reference them with something easier?

### Update Move.toml

Edit the `Move.toml` file by adding the following under `[addresses]` section:

```markdown
metaschool = "<Your-wallet-address-goes-here>"
std = "0x1"
```

Pop your wallet address into the quotation marks in metaschool= "". We use metaschool as a nickname for our wallet address to make it easier to reference and maintain. This way, we donâ€™t have to keep typing out the long address, which makes our code cleaner and easier to read. Even though our smart contract is pretty simple right now, using aliases like this will be a big help when we start working on more complex projects in the upcoming courses.

And yayyy, we have learned a lot, havenâ€™t we? From being a novice to knowing so much about the Aptos Move, you have come a long way, Great job!

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Wow, we've been on a wild ride, haven't we? You've been absolutely stellar in crafting your project and mastering the Move package structure. Now, in our next lesson, get ready to dive headfirst into coding for our Calculator dApp and launching it into the blockchain! Exciting times ahead!
