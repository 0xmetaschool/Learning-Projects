# Mastering the Art of Structuring Your dApp

Hey there, rockstars! Welcome back! We're absolutely thrilled to see you taking on your first Move project and totally rocking that calculator dApp.

Today, we're diving into the fun part – giving our calculator dApp some structure. This step is super important for any Move dApp, and especially for our calculator dApp built with the Move programming language.

When we talk about structuring, we're talking about adding structs to the module of our dApp. But don't sweat it – we'll break down what structs are all about before we weave them into our `calculator` module. Let's get this party started! 

## What is exactly the struct?

Imagine you have three awesome toys: a speedy car, an Iron Man action figure, and a cuddly teddy bear. Your shelf is pretty cramped, so you decide to put all these toys into one box labeled "toys."

That's basically how a struct works! You group different types of data that represent certain things together. In our toy analogy, the box acts like a struct, keeping all your toys organized in one place. Now, let's take a peek at a coding version of this example:

```
Box {
    toy1,
    toy2,
    toy3
}

```

In the coding world, a struct lets you store various types of data together in one neat package. You could store a number, a string of letters, a boolean flag, and more, all within a single struct. 

### Struct declaration

In Move, we declare a struct using `struct` keyword.

Imagine you need to send a parcel to your friend. You want to keep track of your address, your friend's address, the parcel’s name, the shipment price, and whether the parcel has been delivered. Here's how you can bundle all this information into a struct:

```
struct Parcel {
    address sender;
    address receiver;
    u64 shipmentPrice;
    bool delivered;
}

```

Pretty neat, right? We’ve combined different data types into a single struct called `Parcel`. This way, all your parcel information is organized in one place. Don’t worry about the data types for now because we will discuss them in detail in the upcoming lessons.

### Creating and initializing the struct variable

Now that we've defined our struct, the next step is to learn how to use it and fill in all the juicy details. To do this, we create a variable of our struct type. Yep, you heard it right—type struct! When we create a struct, it's like crafting a brand-new data type that bundles together multiple pieces of data.

Let's see how to create a variable for our `Parcel` struct:

```
let parcel = Parcel {
    sender: 0x2,
    receiver: 0x3,
    shipmentPrice: 20,
    delivered: false
};

```

What just happened here? We created a variable named `parcel` of type `Parcel`, and then we initialized each field within our struct with specific values. Don’t worry about the fields and their types for now because we will discuss them in the upcoming lessons.

This way, all your parcel info is neatly packed into one variable, making your code cleaner and more efficient.

## Why structs are awesome

Here’s a quick rundown of why structs are a game-changer:

- **Complex Data Handling**: Structs let you handle complex data structures that combine various data types.
- **Organized and Secure**: They group related data fields together, promoting privacy, organization, and encapsulation.

- **Modular Magic**: Structs encapsulate data and behavior, making your code modular and reusable across different parts of your program.
- **Clear and Maintainable**: By bundling related data, structs make your code easier to read and maintain.

## Cool struct features in Move

Before we dive deeper, let’s check out some unique features of structs in Move that make them special:

- **No Visibility Specifiers**: Structs can only be created or destroyed within the module they’re defined in and can’t be accessed by other modules.
- **Module-Scoped**: Structs are only accessible within the module that defines them.
- **No Copying or Dropping**: In Move, structs are linear and ephemeral, meaning they can't be copied or dropped. This mirrors real-world assets like money, which shouldn't be duplicated or lost.

This feature of not being copied or dropped helps model real-world assets, ensuring they remain unique and don't disappear unexpectedly.

Now, you're all set to use this struct in your Move project and make your dApp even more awesome! 🚀 Let's keep the momentum going and have some fun coding! 

## Let’s define struct in our calculator dApp

First, remove the current code in `calculator.move` file, and let's write it from the beginning. Add the below code in the file:

```
module metaschool::calculator {
    struct Calculator {
        result: u64,
    }

    fun create_calculator(){   
        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
    }
}
```

Let’s focus on the struct part and understand what we did in the code.

- We created a `Calculator` struct inside the `calculator` module with one field, `result`. Here, we will use a `calculator` struct to store the result of the calculator's operation. For example, if we want to store the addition result, we will store it in the `Calculator`'s `result` field.
**Note:** It is important to specify the data type for the struct field. Don’t worry! We will explore data types in detail in upcoming lessons.
- Next, inside the function (`create_calculator`), we are initializing the `calculator` variable using the `Calculator` struct.

Now, we also have to update the name in `Move.toml` file. Under `[package]` update the name to 'calculator', same as the module name in the code.

## That’s a wrap

In Move, structs play an important role because they allow us to store crucial data with ease so that the data can be easily manageable and accessible. Whew! Next, we will learn how ownership and resources work in the Aptos Move world!
