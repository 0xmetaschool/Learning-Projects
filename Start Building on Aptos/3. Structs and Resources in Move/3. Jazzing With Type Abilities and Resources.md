# Jazzing With Type Abilities and Resources

Welcome back, folks!! We're thrilled to have you with us again! Last time, you mastered the concepts of ownership, signers, and resources in Aptos Move.

In this lesson, we're going to take things up a notch. First, we'll dive deep into type abilities, then we'll explore various functions for manipulating resources, and finally, we'll tackle a brand-new concept called acquire.

By the end of this lesson, we'll have all these exciting concepts integrated into our `calculator` dApp, and you'll see our `create_calculator` function in action. Let's get started! 

## Usage of resources

We did a small overview of type abilities, now it is time to dive deep into them and learn them in detail using examples. Eventually, we will need these type abilities in our `calculator` dApp.

### Using `key`

In Move, the `key` ability is like giving your structs or resource types a unique identifier. Think of it as a special address where the struct or resource is stored and accessed in the global storage. By default, every member of a struct with the `key` ability also has the `store` ability, meaning it can be safely stored in the global storage.

Imagine you own a pizza shop and want to keep track of the different types of pizzas you offer. You can create a `Pizza` struct with the `key` ability like this:

```
struct Pizza has key {
    price: u64,
}

fun create_pizza(account: &signer) {
    let pizza = Pizza { price: 0 };
    move_to(account, pizza); // Move the `Pizza` struct to the account's global storage
}

```

In this example, the `Pizza` struct has a single field `price` of type `u64` (an unsigned 64-bit integer). The `create_pizza` function takes an `account` (a reference to a signer, like a customer's ID), creates a new `Pizza` struct with a default price of 0, and then uses the `move_to` function to store this `Pizza` struct in the global storage associated with that `account`. It’s like adding a unique pizza to a customer's order history!

### Using `store`

The `store` ability allows a struct to be stored inside another struct as a field, and then as a key in the global storage. For example, our `Pizza` struct could look like this: `struct Pizza { price: u64, toppings: Toppings }`. This means the struct with the `store` ability doesn't always have to be a top-level resource in the global storage.

You might be wondering, after learning about the `key` ability, if the fields of a struct with the `key` ability always get stored in the global storage. Well, the fields of a struct with the `key` ability indeed have the `store` ability, but they aren't stored as top-level resources.

Let’s take a look at a pizza example using the `store` ability:

```
module pizza::pizza {
    use std::signer;

    struct Toppings has key, store {
        want: bool,
    }

    struct Pizza has key {
        price: u64,
        toppings: Toppings,
    }

    fun create_pizza(account: &signer) {
        let topping = Toppings { want: true };
        let new_pizza = Pizza { price: 0, toppings: topping };
        move_to(account, new_pizza); // Move the `Pizza` struct to the account's global storage
    }
}

```

In this example, the `Toppings` struct has a `bool` field `want`, indicating whether the customer wants toppings. The `Pizza` struct now includes a `Toppings` field alongside the `price`. The `create_pizza` function creates a `Toppings` struct with `want` set to `true`, then a `Pizza` struct with a price of 0 and the toppings. Finally, it moves the `Pizza` struct into the global storage associated with the `account`.

### Using `copy`

Sometimes, you might want to make copies of a struct for various purposes. In Move, the `copy` ability lets you create duplicates. Imagine you want to copy a pizza order for your records:

```
struct Toppings has store {
    want: bool,
}

struct Pizza has key, copy {
    price: u64,
    toppings: Toppings,
}

fun create_pizza(account: &signer) {
    let topping = Toppings { want: true };
    let pizza = Pizza { price: 0, toppings: topping };
    let copy_of_pizza = copy pizza; // `copy` keyword allows you to duplicate the struct
    move_to(account, pizza); // Move the `Pizza` struct to the account's global storage
}

```

In this example, the `Pizza` struct has both `key` and `copy` abilities. The `create_pizza` function creates a `Toppings` struct, a `Pizza` struct, and then makes a copy of the `Pizza` struct using the `copy` keyword. Finally, it moves the original `Pizza` struct into the global storage associated with the `account`. It’s like making a duplicate order slip for your records!

### Using `drop`

The `drop` ability in Move lets you automatically discard a struct when it goes out of scope, helping to manage memory and prevent resource leaks. Imagine you want to create a `Sauce` struct that represents a temporary sauce order:

```
struct Toppings has store {
    want: bool,
}

struct Pizza has key, copy {
    price: u64,
    toppings: Toppings,
}

struct Sauce has drop {
    want: bool,
}

fun create_pizza(account: &signer) {
    let topping = Toppings { want: true };
    let pizza = Pizza { price: 0, toppings: topping };
    let sauce = Sauce { want: true }; // The `Sauce` struct will be dropped after this function scope
    let copy_of_pizza = copy pizza;
    move_to(account, pizza); // Move the `Pizza` struct to the account's global storage
}

```

In this example, the `Sauce` struct has a `bool` field `want` and the `drop` ability. The `create_pizza` function creates a `Toppings` struct, a `Pizza` struct, and a `Sauce` struct with `want` set to `true`. Once the function scope ends, the `Sauce` struct is automatically dropped from memory. It’s like a temporary sauce order you don’t need to keep track of once the pizza is made and delivered!

Get ready to use these abilities and make your Move project even more awesome. Let’s keep the excitement rolling and understand how to manipulate these resources, transfer their ownership, and store them in global storage! 

## Resource manipulation

Alright, adventurers of the blockchain! 🌟 Ready to learn how to wield the power of Move like a true coding wizard? Let’s dive into resource manipulation and see how we can make our data evolve, adapt, and respond to real-time demands, creating dynamic and lively blockchain applications!

![Untitled](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Jazzing%20With%20Type%20Abilities%20and%20Resources/Untitled%20(8).webp?raw=true)

To master resource manipulation in Move, you only need to know five instructions. Each one serves a unique purpose, making your smart contracts super functional. Let’s get started!

### 1. `move_to<T>(&signer, T)`

First up is `move_to()`. This powerful instruction transfers resources or data structures of type `T`.

Imagine you want to transfer tokens from one account to another. You'd use `move_to<Token>(&signer, recipient)` where `&signer` is the sender's account. But be careful! If the sender doesn't have enough tokens, the transaction could abort due to an insufficient balance.

```
module example::example {
    fun transfer_token(sender: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64) {
        let token: &mut Token = borrow_global_mut<Token>(sender);
        token.balance -= amount;
        move_to<Token>(sender, recipient);
    }
}

```

In this module, the `transfer_token` function moves tokens between accounts. It starts by defining parameters: `sender` (the sender's account), `recipient` (the receiver's account), and `amount` (tokens to transfer). Then, it borrows the sender's tokens (we’ll explain `borrow_global_mut` in a second), subtracts the transfer amount, and finally, uses `move_to<Token>` to transfer ownership to the recipient. This module shows off Move's efficiency in handling token transfers on the blockchain.

### 2. `move_from<T>(address): T`

Need to fetch a resource from a specific address on the blockchain? That’s where `move_from<T>(address)` comes in handy.

You provide the address from which you want to retrieve the resource or data structure. `move_from` will fetch the resource of type `T` and return it to you.

```
module example::example {
    fun get_resource_from_address(address: address): Token {
        move_from<Token>(address)
    }
}

```

In this module, the `get_resource_from_address` function fetches the `Token` resource from the given address using `move_from<Token>(address)`. It's like grabbing a specific item from a vast warehouse shelf and returning it ready for use. Keep in mind, if the address doesn’t hold a resource of type `<T>`, it will abort.

### 3. `borrow_global_mut<T>(address): &mut T`

Want to update a resource? Use `borrow_global_mut<T>(address)` to borrow a mutable reference to a global resource. For instance, say you want to update the balance of a token holder. You'd use `borrow_global_mut<Token>(account)` to access and modify the token's balance. But be cautious! If the requested resource doesn't exist at the specified address, the borrow operation could abort.

```
module example::example {
    fun update_balance(account: address, new_balance: u64) {
        let token: &mut Token = borrow_global_mut<Token>(account);
        token.balance = new_balance;
    }
}

```

Here, the `update_balance` function updates a user’s token balance on the blockchain. It borrows the `Token` resource from the user’s account using `borrow_global_mut<Token>(account)`. This lets us modify the token’s balance without transferring ownership.

### 4. `borrow_global<T>(address): &T`

Next up is `borrow_global<T>(address): &T`, which is similar to `borrow_global_mut`, but it borrows an immutable reference instead. This is handy for read-only operations like checking an account's token balance. If the resource doesn't exist at the specified address, this borrow operation may also abort.

```
module example::example {
    fun get_balance(account: address): u64 {
        let token: &Token = borrow_global<Token>(account);
        token.balance
    }
}

```

In this script, the `get_balance` function fetches and returns the balance of a user’s token. It borrows the `Token` resource from the user’s account using `borrow_global<Token>(account)`. This allows us to read the balance without modifying it.

**Important Note:**

When using `borrow_global` or `borrow_global_mut`, references to global resources act similarly to local storage references. However, you cannot return a reference that points directly to global storage. This restriction ensures safe resource handling in Move programs.

### 5. `exists<T>(address): bool`

Finally, We have `exists<T>(address): bool`. This instruction checks if a resource of type `T` exists at a given address. For example, if you're verifying the existence of a token, you'd use `exists<Token>(account)`. However, it's crucial to note that the abort case for this instruction is unlikely unless there are underlying issues with resource existence checks in the Move VM.

```
module example::example {
    fun token_exists(account: address): bool {
        exists<Token>(account)
    }
}

```

In this module, the `token_exists` function checks if a token exists for a specific account address. The `exists<Token>(account)` instruction returns `true` if the token exists and `false` otherwise. This helps ensure your application can validate the presence of tokens before performing any operations.

## Acquires

Alright, let's dive into the awesome world of resources and how manipulation functions make everything run smoothly!

When a function tries to access a resource using `move_from`, `borrow_global`, or `borrow_global_mut`, it must indicate that it `acquires` that resource. This helps the Move type system ensure that references into global storage are safe and that there are no dangling references.

Let's break down a coding example to make this crystal clear:

```
module example::example {
    struct Token has key {
        balance: u64,
    }

    fun update_balance(account: address, new_balance: u64) acquires Token {
        let token: &mut Token = borrow_global_mut<Token>(account);
        token.balance = new_balance;
        move_to<Token>(account, token);
    }
}

```

In this example, we added `acquires Token` at the end of the function definition. This ensures that the function, which uses `borrow_global_mut` and `move_to`, properly handles the `Token` resource.

And here's a cool tip: when you use a function that has acquired the resource in another module, you don't need to use `acquires` again. Resources defined in one module aren't accessible to another module, ensuring everything stays safe and sound.

Understanding these instructions is key to mastering resource manipulation in Move programming. With these tools, you can build secure and reliable smart contracts that make your blockchain applications dynamic and efficient. Now go forth and code like a wizard! 🚀✨

## Let’s add everything to the `calculator` dApp

Now, let’s move forward and add abilities to the `Calculator` struct that we defined in the last lesson.

```
module metaschool::calculator {
		use std::signer;	

		// Rsource with key ability
    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

		// Function acquires the Calculator resource
    fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
    
			  // We check if the signer address already has a Calculator resource
			  // associated to it
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
        
		        // Here, we are using borrow_global_mut to fetch the Calculator resource
		        // associated with the signer address
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            calculator.result = 0;
        }
        else {
        
	        // If no Calculator resource is present for the input signer address
	        // then we create a new instance of a resource
	        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
	        move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down what we did in the code!

1. We gave the `Calculator` resource the `key` ability, which lets us publish it to global storage. We talked about this in our last lesson.
2. We added the `acquires` keyword to the function definition. This allows the function to manipulate the `Calculator` resource within the `create_calculator` function.
3. We used the `exists` function to check if the resource for the given signer's address is already published.
4. If the resource exists, we fetch a mutable reference to it using the `borrow_global_mut` function. This lets us access and modify the resource associated with the signer's address.
5. If the resource doesn't exist, we create a new instance of the `Calculator` and publish it to the signer's address using the `move_to` function.

Pretty neat, right? Now, let's see all these concepts come together in action! Try running the program using `aptos move compile` command and then deploy it using the  `aptos move publish` command.

## That’s a wrap

Phew! We’ve packed a ton of cool features into our `calculator` module in this lesson. Now, every user gets their own resource and result for each operation. This means one user can’t mess with another user’s results. Plus, our calculator dApp can handle multiple users and addresses all at the same time.

Don’t forget all the awesome stuff we’ve covered in this and the last lesson, because we’ll be building on it in the upcoming lessons.

Stay tuned, because next up, we’re diving into the world of variables and constants in Aptos Move. It’s going to be a blast! 🚀
