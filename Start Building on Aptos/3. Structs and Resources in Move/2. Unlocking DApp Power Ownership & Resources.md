# Unlocking DApp Power: Ownership & Resources

Welcome back, rockstars!! ðŸŒŸ You totally nailed the last lesson by mastering structs and seeing how crucial they are in the world of Aptos Move. You even implemented structs in your `calculator` dApp. Awesome job!

But we hit a snag with our struct. Remember how we mentioned that in Move, you can't copy, drop, or use structs outside their defining module? Well, it is what it is. But donâ€™t worry! Thereâ€™s a way around it. We can add abilities to structs so that we can copy, drop, or save them in the global state, allowing us to fetch and use them whenever we want.

But in Move, a resource-oriented programming language, we call these structs a resource that cannot be copied or dropped.

In this lesson, we are going to get an overview of resources, type abilities, ownership, signer, acquires, and how Move is a resource-oriented programming language, and then supercharge our `calculator` dApp with all this knowledge. Letâ€™s get started and have some fun! 

## Letâ€™s discover resource-oriented programming

First, let's get a grip on what kind of language Move is. You've probably heard that Java, Python, and C++ are object-oriented programming languages. Well, Move has its special type too!

Move is a resource-oriented programming language. Itâ€™s a fresh way to manage memory where a resource is owned by its owner. In Move, what we call structs and objects are known as resources. A resource is essentially a bundle of variables that can only be copied once at a time. This means if you pass a resource to a function, you canâ€™t use it elsewhere at the same time.

Here are the three golden rules for resources in resource-oriented programming:

1. **Unique Memory Location**: Each resource exists in only one memory location - no duplicates allowed!
2. **Ownership Defined by Storage**: Thereâ€™s no central ledger tracking ownership; itâ€™s all about where the resource is stored.
3. **Exclusive Access**: Only the owner of the resource can access its methods.

These principles show that resources provide a new way to represent asset ownership and the characteristics of crypto-enabled digital assets directly within the programming language. A standout feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types. These types are used to create secure digital assets with rich programmability.

## WTH are resources

Alright, let's dive back into the fascinating world of *Resources*! We've touched on this before, but let's give it a proper review.

In Move, if struct values can't be copied or dropped, they're called resources. Essentially, in Move programming, we refer to structs and objects as resources, and these bad boys canâ€™t be copied or dropped.

By default, structs are linear and ephemeral. Sound complicated? Letâ€™s simplify it! It means structs can't be copied, dropped, or stored in global storage. But don't worry, Move gives us superpowers to change this with abilities like key, store, copy, and drop.

So, remember, we've got four cool abilities we can attach to our resources: key, store, copy, and drop. Easy peasy!

Next, letâ€™s get a brief introduction to type abilities which give resources the ability to be copied, dropped, or stored in a global storage. Let's keep the fun rolling! ðŸš€

## WTH are type abilities

By default, resources have no ability, meaning we canâ€™t copy a struct, we canâ€™t store it in a global storage, and we cannot even destroy it. So, to cater to this, type abilities were introduced. This means they give structs and data types different kinds of abilities like the ability to copy the struct or store them in the global state.

So, Move programming language offers four types of abilities that a struct can have. These abilities are key, store, copy, and drop.

As perÂ [Aptos Move abilities definitions](https://aptos.dev/move/book/abilities/),Â the definition of four abilities are:

- [`copy`](https://aptos.dev/move/book/abilities/#copy)
    - Allows values of types with this ability to be copied.
- [`drop`](https://aptos.dev/move/book/abilities/#drop)
    - Allows values of types with this ability to be popped/dropped.
- [`store`](https://aptos.dev/move/book/abilities/#store)
    - Allows values of types with this ability to exist inside a resource in global storage.
- [`key`](https://aptos.dev/move/book/abilities/#key)
    - Allows the type to serve as a key for global storage operations.

To use these abilities with a resource, we use `has` keyword like this:

```
struct has key {
		// struct field go here
}
```

## How ownership works in Move

In Move, ownership works like a super-organized system for managing valuable assets and memory. Each asset, or resource, has just one owner at a time, and ownership can be transferred from one person to another. This clever system helps Move keep things tidy, avoid data clashes, and manage memory like a pro.

Imagine you have a token representing a digital asset. When you transfer that token to someone else, you're passing the ownership of that asset to them. This ensures there's always a clear owner for each asset, maintaining order and preventing conflicts in your program.

By handling ownership this way, Move ensures efficient memory use, keeps data secure, and ensures smooth operations within the program. It's like having a super-organized digital ledger that tracks who owns what.

To manage ownership, Move provides some handy functions that we'll explore in a bit: `move_to`, `borrow_global`, `move_from`, and `borrow_global_mut`. The `move_to` function is super simpleâ€”it moves the resource to the given account under the `signer.address`, pushing the resource to the blockchain. Get ready to dive into these functions and see how they keep everything running smoothly!

## WTH is signer

In Move, the `signer` is a built-in resource type that plays a crucial role in authentication and authorization. It's like having a digital signature that grants you the power to act on behalf of a specific address on the blockchain.

The `signer` is a capability that allows the holder to perform actions on behalf of a particular `address`.

The `signer` values are unique because they cannot be created directly within the Move code. Instead, they are created and provided by the Move Virtual Machine (VM) itself.

Here's an example of how a `signer` is used in a script:

```
module example::signer_example {
    use std::signer;
    fun main(s: signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(&s) == @0x42, 0);
    }
}
```

In this script, the VM will automatically create a `signer` value and pass it into the `main` function. The `assert` statement checks that the `address` wrapped by the `signer` is `0x42`. If the module is sent from any other address, it will abort with code `0`.

### `signer` Operators

The `std::signer` standard library module provides two utility functions for working with `signer` values:

- `signer::address_of(&signer): address`: Returns the `address` wrapped by the `&signer`. Which means it will return the address of the signer.
- `signer::borrow_address(&signer): &address`: Returns a reference to the `address` wrapped by the `&signer`.

Get ready to master these functions and see how they can make your Move project even cooler. Letâ€™s keep the excitement rolling and dive into the details! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

## Using signer in calculator dApp

Letâ€™s see how you can use the signer in your calculator dApp.

```
module metaschool::calculator {
		use std::signer;	

		// Resource with key ability
    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

		// Passing the signer address to the function
    fun create_calculator(account: &signer) {
	    // Defined the Calculator instance
	    let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
	    // Published the Calculator instance to the account provided
	    move_to(account, calculator);
    }
}
```

This code won't run perfectly just yet, but let's break down what we did here:

1. We gave our `struct` resource the `key` ability, allowing us to store the `Calculator` resource in the global storage.
2. We passed the `signer` account to the `create_calculator` function. The `&` sign with `signer` allows us to use the `signer::address_of(&signer): address` function, which we'll dive into in upcoming lessons.
3. We used `move_to` to publish the `Calculator` resource to the signer's account.

So, even though it won't run just yet, we've set up some crucial steps for our `calculator` module. Keep goingâ€”you're doing great!

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Phew, you did great!! Grasping how Move is resource-oriented and understanding resources, ownership, and signer functionality is key to programming securely and efficiently in Aptos Move.

But wait, thereâ€™s more!! We still need to dive into type abilities and explore different functions to manipulate resources. So, in the next lesson, weâ€™ll dig into these concepts in detail and incorporate them into our calculator dApp. Stay tuned!
