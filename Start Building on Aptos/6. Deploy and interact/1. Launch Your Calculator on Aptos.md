# Launch Your Calculator on Aptos

Welcome back, folks!! We’re so proud of how far you’ve come in this course. You’re almost at the finish line! In this lesson, we’re going to fully interact with the calculator dApp we've built together.

We’ll revisit how to deploy the dApp to the Aptos testnet and explore its various features.

Finally, we’ll guide you on how to deploy your dApp to the mainnet, so you can launch your amazing creation if you wish. Let’s dive in and bring your dApp to life!

## Complete code 101

Before moving forward let us show you how the complete and final look of the `calculator` module looks like.

```
module metaschool::calculator {
    use std::error;
    use std::signer;

    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

    public entry fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            calculator.result = 0;
        }
        else {
        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
        move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }

    public entry fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = num1 + num2;

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun subtract(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num1 > num2){
            calculator.result = num1 - num2;
            get_result(account);

        }
        else {
            calculator.result = num2 - num1;
            get_result(account);

        }
    }

    public entry fun multiply(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = num1 * num2;

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun divide(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num2 == 0) {
            abort error::invalid_argument(0)
        } else {
            calculator.result = num1 / num2;
        };

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun power(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num2 == 0) {
            abort error::invalid_argument(0)
        } else {
            let i = 1;
            calculator.result = num1;
            while (i < num2){
                calculator.result = calculator.result * num1;
                i = i + 1;
            }
 
        };

        get_result(account);
    }

    public fun get_result (account: &signer): u64 acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result
    }
}
```

## Set up the project

We have already pushed the complete code with the front end to GitHub for your ease. You just need to set it up in your system. So, follow the following steps to set it up.

1. Run the following command to clone the `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` repository if you haven’t cloned it so far.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate.git
    ```

2. After cloning the repo, head over to your newly or already cloned project and run the following command to fetch all of the branches from the repo.
    ```
    cd Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate
    git fetch --all
    ```

3. At last, run the following command to work with the complete and final calculator dApp.
    ```
    git checkout complete_code
    ```

## Deploy your dApp to the Aptos Blockchain testnet

To deploy our dApp, we first need to set up the `Move.toml` file. So, head over to the Move.toml and replace `<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>` with your wallet address.

```
metaschool = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
std = "0x1"
```

Next, you need to move to the `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` project folder and run `aptos init` command. Make sure to select testnet as your network and provide a private key when prompted.

Next, compile the code using the following command:

```
aptos move compile
```

![aptos-compile.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/aptos-compile.png?raw=true)

At last, deploy the code using the following command:

```
aptos move publish
```

Type “yes” when the command asks if you want to pay for the transaction. And kudos, you have deployed the code successfully. This is a snippet of a successful deployment.

![aptos-publish.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/aptos-publish.png?raw=true)

## Set up the frontend

Head over to the `interface` folder using the following command

```
cd interface 
```

Then, set the `REACT_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS` variable in the `.env` file with your wallet address.

```
REACT_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
```

Finally, run `npm install`and launch the app using the `npm start` command.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Interact with the frontend

Alright, let’s dive into each feature of the frontend one by one!

1. **First, connect with the Petra wallet:** Hit the “Connect Wallet” button and get connected.

2. **Turn on the calculator:** Click the “Turn On” button to power up the calculator.
    
    ![interact-2.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-2.gif?raw=true)
    
3. **Add two numbers:** Select the first number, press the “+” operator, pick the second number, and then click the equal sign. Approve the transaction to see the result.

4. **Subtract two numbers:** Clear the screen by pressing the “C” button, then perform the subtraction.

5. **Multiply two numbers:** Now, try out the multiplication feature.
    
    ![interact-5.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-5.gif?raw=true)
    
6. **Divide two numbers:** Give the division function a go.
    
    ![interact-6.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-6.gif?raw=true)
    
7. **Use the power function:** Finally, test out the power function.
    
    ![interact-7.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-7.gif?raw=true)
    
8. **Made a mistake? No problem!** If you enter a wrong digit, just use the “←” button to backspace and correct it.
    
    ![interact-8.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-8.gif?raw=true)
    

## Deploy your dApp to the mainnet

To deploy the dApp to the mainnet, first of all, switch your network to mainnet on Petra Wallet using the “switch to Mainnet” button.

![switch-mainnet.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet.png?raw=true)

Then buy some APT tokens because without them you won’t be able to deploy your dApp. Buy the APT tokens with real money.

![switch-mainnet-2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet-2.png?raw=true)

After buying the tokens head back to `Building-on-Aptos` project folder and run `aptos init` command. Make sure to select “mainnet” as your network and provide a private key when prompted.

![switch-mainnet-3.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet-3.png?raw=true)

Finally, run the `aptos move publish` command to publish your dApp to the mainnet.

## That’s a wrap

Fantastic job, buddy!! We’re incredibly proud of you!! You’ve developed the calculator dApp, deployed it on the testnet, and even connected it to the frontend.

You’re now ready to create even more dApps on Aptos Move. Great work!! Let’s recap what we’ve learned in this course and wrap things up.
