# Launch Your Calculator on Aptos

Welcome back, folks!! We’re so proud of how far you’ve come in this course. You’re almost at the finish line! In this lesson, we’re going to fully interact with the calculator dApp we've built together.

We’ll revisit how to deploy the dApp to the Aptos testnet and explore its various features.

Finally, we’ll guide you on how to deploy your dApp to the mainnet, so you can launch your amazing creation if you wish. Let’s dive in and bring your dApp to life!

## Complete code 101

Before moving forward let us show you how the complete and final look of the `calculator` module looks like.

```
module metaschool::final_calculator {
    use std::error;
    use std::signer;

    struct Calculator has key {
        result: u64,
    }

    public entry fun create_calculator(account: &signer) acquires Calculator {
        if (exists<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
            calculator.result = 0;
        }
        else {
        let calculator = Calculator { result: 0 };
        move_to(account, calculator);
        }
    }

    public entry fun add(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = num1 + num2;

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun subtract(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num1 > num2){
            calculator.result = num1 - num2;
            get_result(account);

        }
        else {
            calculator.result = num2 - num1;
            get_result(account);

        }
    }

    public entry fun multiply(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result = num1 * num2;

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun divide(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num2 == 0) {
            abort error::invalid_argument(0)
        } else {
            calculator.result = num1 / num2;
        };

        get_result(account);
    }

    public entry fun power(account: &signer, num1: u64, num2: u64) acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global_mut<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        if (num2 == 0) {
            abort error::invalid_argument(0)
        } else {
            let i = 1;
            calculator.result = num1;
            while (i < num2){
                calculator.result = calculator.result * num1;
                i = i + 1;
            }
 
        };

        get_result(account);
    }

    public fun get_result (account: &signer): u64 acquires Calculator {
        let calculator = borrow_global<Calculator>(signer::address_of(account));
        calculator.result
    }
}
```

## Set up the project

We have already pushed the complete code with the front end to GitHub for your ease. You just need to set it up in your system. So, follow the following steps to set it up. Run the following command to move to our required branch:
```
git checkout origin/complete_code  
```

## Deploy your dApp to the Aptos Blockchain testnet

1. In the `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` directory, run the following command: 
    ```
    aptos init
    ```   
2. Skip this step if your wallet is already configured. Type in “testnet” for your network and provide your Private key when prompted. 
3. Edit the `Move.toml` file by adding your Wallet address against `metaschool`:
    ```
    metaschool = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
    ```
4. Compile the code using the following command:   
    ```
    aptos move compile --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
    ```
5.  Now, deploy the code using the following command:  
    ```
    aptos move publish --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
    ```

## Set up the frontend

1. Change the directory to the `interface` folder:
    ```
    cd ./interface
    ```    
2. With the terminal still in the `interface` directory, install all the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    You can ignore the warning generated in the terminal. Once done you should be able to find a `.env` file in your `interface` folder and it would look something like this:
    ```
    REACT_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS = "<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>"
    REACT_APP_MODULE_NAME= "final_calculator"
    ```
3. Replace your Petra wallet address with `<Enter-your-wallet-address-here>`. And now we are all set, Finally set sail and deploy our react App by running.
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Interact with the frontend

Alright, let’s dive into each feature of the frontend one by one!

1. **First, connect with the Petra wallet:** Hit the “Connect Wallet” button and get connected.

2. **Turn on the calculator:** Click the “Turn On” button to power up the calculator.

3. **Add two numbers:** Select the first number, press the “+” operator, pick the second number, and then click the equal sign. Approve the transaction to see the result.

4. **Subtract two numbers:** Clear the screen by pressing the “C” button, then perform the subtraction.

5. **Multiply two numbers:** Now, try out the multiplication feature.

6. **Divide two numbers:** Give the division function a go.
    
    ![interact-6.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-6.webp?raw=true)
    
7. **Use the power function:** Finally, test out the power function.
    
    ![interact-7.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-7.webp?raw=true)
    
8. **Made a mistake? No problem!** If you enter a wrong digit, just use the “←” button to backspace and correct it.
    
    ![interact-8.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/interact-8.webp?raw=true)
    
## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `Building-on-Aptos-boilerplate` folder. If you are in `interface` folder just run `cd ../` to return to the previous directory. Push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 
```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## Deploy your dApp to the mainnet

To deploy the dApp to the mainnet, first of all, switch your network to mainnet on Petra Wallet using the “switch to Mainnet” button.

![switch-mainnet.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet.webp?raw=true)

Then buy some APT tokens because without them you won’t be able to deploy your dApp. Buy the APT tokens with real money.

![switch-mainnet-2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet-2.webp?raw=true)

After buying the tokens head back to `Building-on-Aptos` project folder and run `aptos init` command. Make sure to select “mainnet” as your network and provide a private key when prompted.

![switch-mainnet-3.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/aptos-c2-building-on-aptos-assets/Launch%20Your%20Calculator%20on%20Aptos/switch-mainnet-3.webp?raw=true)

Finally, run the `aptos move publish` command to publish your dApp to the mainnet.

## That’s a wrap

Fantastic job, buddy!! We’re incredibly proud of you!! You’ve developed the calculator dApp, deployed it on the testnet, and even connected it to the frontend.

You’re now ready to create even more dApps on Aptos Move. Great work!! Let’s recap what we’ve learned in this course and wrap things up.
