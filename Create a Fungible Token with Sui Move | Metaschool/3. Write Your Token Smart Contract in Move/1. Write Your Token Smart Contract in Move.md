# Write Your Token Smart Contract in Move

Welcome back!  So you completed setting up your environment. You did awesome! Well, get ready because, in this lesson, you're going to learn how to write your token.  Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Write code

Navigate to the `sources/pepe.move`. Let's go through the code line by line that you will be writing:

First, `metaschool` is the package name. It should be the same as the name of the folder we used to initialize the Sui workspace using the command `sui move new metaschool`. So, if you have used any other name, make sure to replace it here. Moreover, `pepe` is the module name. So, if you have named it something else than the `pepe`, make sure to update it here.

```
module metaschool::pepe {
```

- This line defines a module named `metaschool::pepe`, which will contain the Move token implementation. A module is a way to organize code and group related functionality together.

    ```
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
    ```

- Import modules (`std::option`, `sui::coin`, `sui::transfer`, and `sui::tx_context`) that contain pre-built functions and types to be used in the code.

    ```
    struct PEPE has drop {}
    ```

- Define a new struct called `PEPE` with `has drop` attribute.

    ```
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::some(url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(b"https://silver-blushing-woodpecker-143.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmed2qynTAszs9SiZZpf58QeXcNcYgPnu6XzkD4oeLacU4")), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }
    ```

- Define a function called `init`, which is the module initializer.
- The `init` function takes the following:
    - Move utilizes a witness design pattern that states that a type passed can only be initiated once. The witness resource needs to be consumed or discarded right away to prevent creating multiple instances of the given object.
    - The one-time witness (OTW) is a special type in Move on Sui that always has one instance. It is used wherever we want certain actions to happen once. For example, creating a coin one time. You can explore more about OTW here: [https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/one-time-witness](https://docs.sui.io/concepts/sui-move-concepts/one-time-witness)
    - So we passed the `PEPE` struct that has drop functionality.
    - We also passed a mutable reference to `TxContext`.
- Inside the function, call the `coin::create_currency` function to create a new PEPE currency:
    - Pass the `PEPE` witness as the first argument.
    - The desired decimal places as the second parameter. For example, for 9 as a decimal value; suppose we want to mint 100 tokens, so we need to pass 100*10^9.
    - The symbol of our token is `PE`.
    - The token name is `PEPE` which is the fourth argument.
    - Next, an empty icon URL is added, and an optional metadata too.
- The `coin::create_currency` function returns a tuple containing `treasury` and `metadata` that are `TreasuryCap` and `CoinMetadata` objects respectively.
    - The `TreasuryCap` [i](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sui-move-intro-course/blob/main/unit-two/lessons/6_capability_design_pattern.md)s like a manager that controls access to the `mint` and `burn` methods.
- Call `transfer::public_freeze_object` to freeze the metadata so that no one can change the coin metadata once it's published
- Finally, transfer the `treasury` to the sender of the transaction using `transfer::public_transfer`.

    ```
    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
    }

    ```

- Define a public entry function called `mint`.
- The `mint` function takes a mutable reference to `coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>`, an `amount` of type `u64`, a `recipient` of type `address`, and a mutable reference to `TxContext` as arguments.
- Inside the function, call the `coin::mint_and_transfer` function to mint new tokens and transfer them to the specified `recipient`.

## Complete code

The complete code for this is below, you can paste it into the file created in Move Studio.

```
module metaschool::pepe{
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};
    use sui::url::{Self, Url};

    // Name matches the module name but in UPPERCASE
    public struct PEPE has drop {}

    // Module initializer is called once on module publish.
    // A treasury cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning.
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::some(url::new_unsafe_from_bytes(b"https://silver-blushing-woodpecker-143.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmed2qynTAszs9SiZZpf58QeXcNcYgPnu6XzkD4oeLacU4")), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
}
```

## Wrap up

Phew! Great work on understanding and creating your first token on Move on Sui. You can explore creating a coin in Sui here: [https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui-framework/coin.md](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/docs/sui-framework/coin.md)

In the next lesson, you will finally deploy the token on the Sui blockchain.
