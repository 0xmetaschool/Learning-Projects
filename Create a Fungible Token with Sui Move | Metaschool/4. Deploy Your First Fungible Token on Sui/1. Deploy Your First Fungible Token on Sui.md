# Deploy Your First Fungible Token on Sui

Welcome back! So you have completed writing your fungible token. You did great! In this lesson, you will dive into deploying your token to the Sui blockchain. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Code

Here’s the complete code of the contract we wrote in the previous lesson, in case you missed it:

```
module metaschool::pepe {
    use std::option;
    use sui::coin;
    use sui::transfer;
    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};

    // Name matches the module name, but in UPPERCASE
    public struct PEPE has drop {}

    // Module initializer is called once on module publish.
    // A treasury cap is sent to the publisher, who then controls minting and burning.
    fun init(witness: PEPE, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        let (treasury, metadata) = coin::create_currency(witness, 9, b"PE", b"PEPE", b"", option::none(), ctx);
        transfer::public_freeze_object(metadata);
        transfer::public_transfer(treasury, tx_context::sender(ctx))
    }

    public entry fun mint(
        treasury: &mut coin::TreasuryCap<PEPE>, amount: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext
    ) {
        coin::mint_and_transfer(treasury, amount, recipient, ctx)
    }
}
```

## Deploy your contract

### Step 1

Firstly, we must go into our `metaschool` directory since it contains our contracts.

```
cd metaschool
```

### Step 2

Now, let’s build our move file using the following command. This will create a new `build` folder and a `Move.toml` file. 

```
sui move build
```

### Step 3

You now need to set up a dev environment in Sui to deploy on the Sui testnet using the following commands: 

```
sui client new-env --alias devnet --rpc https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env devnet
```

### Step 4

Now is the time to publicize your contract. To do so, copy the absolute path of `pepe.move` by right-clicking on it and then selecting the `copy path` option on VS code. Once you have your path, you can now use the following command to publish by replacing `[YOUR_PATH]` with the path you just copied: 

Note: If you are using IDE other than VS code please try finding the exact complete path for `pepe.move` file.

```
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 [YOUR_PATH]
```

### Step 5

Now that you have published the contract, you will get a long output. Scroll and copy the transaction digest. You can use this transaction digest to search for your transaction using Sui Explorer using the following link:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you deployed a fungible token on the Sui blockchain. Good luck with your future deployments!

Next, let’s wrap up the course.
