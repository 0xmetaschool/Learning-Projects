# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone🌈, I am Fareeha and I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Sui blockchain for developers on Metaschool. 🎉

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own token in Move programming language and then deploying it on Sui blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Sui using Move.

Let’s look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course. You will mint your token and view it in your wallet. How exciting!!

**Why Sui?** 

- Meta’s top executives created this Layer-1 blockchain; coool, isn’t it?
- It is another name for security. It offers secure contracts, assets, transactions, and network.
- It handles fee spikes even when demand is higher.
- It supports parallel processing that makes it super fast and it doesn’t sacrifice security.

Not only this, Sui has currently 66 projects listed in its ecosystem including Maven, SuiPad, NodeReal, Chainbase, and many more. It has collaborated with Alibaba and has an amazing ecosystem.

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Sui blockchain and Move
2. Set up Sui Wallet and online development environment
