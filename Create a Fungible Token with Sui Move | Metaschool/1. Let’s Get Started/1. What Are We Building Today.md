# What Are We Building Today

Gm everyone ‚òÄÔ∏è, today we are very excited to bring the third course of our detailed series about Sui blockchain for developers on Metaschool. Let‚Äôs start the third course by congratulating you for completing the first two courses on Sui. Woohoo!

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own token in the Move on Sui and then deploying it on the Sui blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with the necessary knowledge to build on Sui.

Let‚Äôs look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course. You will mint your token and view it in your wallet. How exciting!!
