# Into the World of Stacks

So till now we have a good understanding of what we are building and what exactly we need to build on Stacks right? but what exactly is stacks blockchain and how does it work? This is exactly what I will be helping you learn through this lesson

## So what the heck is Stacks blockchain?

In layman terms, Stacks is bitcoin smart contract layer. Now what exactly is a smart contract layer right? well like EVM which helps you to develop on Ethereum or any EVM chains, Stacks help you to build on bitcoin!

Now how do you pay the gas? In Ethereum, we pay gas using ETH, similarly for Stacks, we pay gas using STX coin which is the native coin of stacks blockchain.

## Now, how does Stacks blockchain work?

This is where things will get interesting, so please spare me your attention, guysssssss!

So, like every other blockchain, let’s start with the [consensus](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/)…..

Unlike bitcoin which uses Proof-of-Work(PoW), Stacks uses Proof-of-Transfer(PoX). Proof of Transfer (PoX) is like using the power of anchor blockchain's cryptocurrency to protect another blockchain. In this case the anchor chain is Bitcoin.

Let me explain this to you with the help of PoW concept.

In PoW, the miner solve complex math problem which requires high computation power, this process is called mining and the miners are rewarded for mining the block. Here there are no stakers involved and the electricity cost is very high.

But in PoX, you don’t need any hardware for participating in mining you just need to have Bitcoin, amazing right? well wait let me dig deep a bit.

So in PoX, there are two participants, the miners and the stackers:

- Miners will spend Bitcoin (Basically transfer) and earn reward in STX coin
- Stackers will lock their STX coin and earn interest for their stack in Bitcoin, in short, Stackers in Stacks blockchain basically just lock STX token they are not a part of consensus.

LET’S DIG DEEPER!

So let’s assume Alice wants to be a miner, so she applies to be the leader for mining the next block by bidding or again basically by spending her Bitcoin. Now there might be so many people like Alice who wants be a miner right? So, how does the protocol select the next miner?

Well for this, the protocol uses **weighted verifiable random function (VRF)** which is like a lottery and selects the leader for mining the next block ensuring fair chance at the same time because its weighted, that is, the probability of Alice getting elected as next leader for mining block also depends on the amount of BTC spent by Alice.

This leader election happens on ***the Bitcoin blockchain,*** so instead of wasting electricity on PoW, PoX reuses already minted BTC by the bitcoin blockchain.

Coming back to the Alice, let’s again assume she won the lottery and has been assigned to mine the next block. Now Alice will write the next block and get rewarded in STX coin.

This is still not over, the amount of Bitcoin Alice spent to be a miner will now be distributed propotionally among stackers based on their percentage of stake on the blockchain and again the stackers who will be getting Alice’s Bitcoin spent will be chosen using weighted VRF.

So, let me summarize everything for you, there are two major participants,

- Miner: Spend BTC —> Wait for their chance to be a Miner —> Participate in block production —> Mine Block —> Earn STX as reward —> Transfer BTC spent to all STX stackers proportionally
- Stackers: Lock STX —> do not participate in block production —> Wait for their chance to get reward —> Earn BTC since they have locked their STX on Stacks blockchain

In short, Stacks brings the best of Bitcoin at minimal cost to you, because here there are no hardware involved thus no electricity. You just need to have BTC!

## Wrap up

Overall, Stacks blockchain is an innovative platform that combines the security of Bitcoin with the flexibility of smart contracts. We explored how consensus, mining and stacking work in Stacks.

So, we covered the cool world of Stacks. Now we will also explore the awesome world of Clarity. 🌐 Stay tuned ‼️
