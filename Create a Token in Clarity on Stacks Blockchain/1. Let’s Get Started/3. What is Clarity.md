# What is Clarity?

Welcome back! So we completed learning about Stacks blockchain. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we will dive into Clarity language. ©️ Are you excited? Let's get started! 

## Introduction to Clarity Programming Language

Clarity is a powerful programming language developed by Blockstack for writing smart contracts on the blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that can automate the process of exchanging value or assets, without the need for intermediaries.
