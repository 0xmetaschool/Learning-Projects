# Clarity Basics - I

Welcome back!  Remember what we talked about in the last lesson? We learned about Clarity and how it works. Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to dive into the fun part - basics of Clarity! Are you excited? Let's get started! 

Before starting, there‚Äôs something unique about clarity and that is we use brackets **()** to define our statements. So let‚Äôs continue our learning journey üõ£Ô∏è

## Data Types

Clarity supports several data types that are commonly used in programming languages, including:

- `int`: A whole number that can be positive or negative.
- `uint`: A whole number that can only be positive (no negatives).
- `bool`: A type that can have only two values: true or false.
- `principal`: An object representing a principal, like a contract principal or standard principal.
- `buff`: A bytes buffer (pieces of information) of maximum length `(max-len)`
- `string-ascii`: A collection of letters and symbols in a simple text format of maximum length `(max-len)`.
- `string-utf8`: A collection of letters, symbols, and special characters of maximum length `(max-len)`. It can include emojis or characters from different languages.
- `list`: A collection of items, like a shopping list of maximum length `(max-len)` with type (entry-type).
- `tuple`: It contains multiple key-value pairs where each label is associated with a specific value type..
- `optional`: A type that can represent a value `(some-value)` or `none` at all. It's useful for cases when something may or may not be present.
- `response`: An object used to show the result of an action. It can indicate success `(ok-type)` or failure `(err-type)` and is often used in programming to handle different outcomes.

Overall, Clarity's data types provide a way to represent and manipulate various types of data within a smart contract, enabling developers to implement complex logic and functionality.

## Variables

In Clarity, there are two types of variables: Local and State.

1. **Local** variables are declared inside functions and are temporary, existing only within the function's scope. They are not stored on the blockchain.
2. **State** variables are declared outside functions and maintain the state of the smart contract. They are accessible from anywhere in the contract and are stored on the blockchain for long-term use.

### Syntax

We can declare a state variable as:

- `define-data-var`¬†: keyword used to define the variable
- `var-name` : name of the variable
- `var-type`¬†: type of the variable that is defined
- `initial-value`¬†: value of the variable

You can **set** value of the variable by:

```
(var-set my-variable 5000)
```

You can **get** value of the variable by:

```
(var-get my-variable)
```

You can **print** value of the variable by:

```
(print (var-get my-variable))
```

You can add **comment** by adding anything after `;;`. 

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned about the basics of Clarity. We talked about data types, including integer, boolean, and blockchain address, and how they are used in Clarity. We also discussed the two types of variables in Clarity, local and state, and how they are declared and used. Additionally, we covered type inference and how it makes writing code easier. 

Next, we will cover more about Clarity basics so stay tuned for the next lesson!üíªüöÄ
