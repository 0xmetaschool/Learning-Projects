# Prerequisites to Deploying Contract

Welcome back!  So we completed coding Calculator in Clarity. Awesome, you did great Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to deploy it!. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## What is Hiro wallet

Crypto wallets play a vital role for developers in testing dapps as they enable connectivity and transaction signing. Hiro wallet serves as a self-custody wallet where users have control over their keys. It is widely utilized within the Stacks ecosystem as a popular choice.

## Setting up Hiro wallet

- To get started, you can easily download the Hiro wallet as a Chrome/Brave extension by clicking [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hiro-wallet/ldinpeekobnhjjdofggfgjlcehhmanlj), or if you're using Firefox, you can download it from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hiro-wallet/).

- Save your secret key and then click "I've backed it up".
    
- Set a password for your Hiro account and click "Continue‚Äù.
- Now you will view a window like this üëáüèº

- Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner and then click on "Change Network".

- Change the network to **Testnet**. We will deploy our smart contracts to the testnet during development and testing.

## Getting some tokens

Now, it's time to acquire some test STX tokens for you to deploy contracts on the Stacks blockchain and carry out transactions. Head over to [this](https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet) link, connect your wallet, and simply click on "Request STX" to get started.

Under the Activity tab of your wallet, you'll soon notice that 500 STX tokens are on their way to you. Keep an eye out for the lightning sign, indicating that the transaction is currently pending. Rest assured that once a new block is mined (usually taking around 10-15 minutes), you'll receive those tokens as expected.

After the next block is successfully mined, you'll witness that the STX tokens in your Balances tab has been added.

The lightning icon in the Activity tab will transform into the received icon. This change signifies that the tokens have been successfully received and added to your account.

## Wrap up

Congratulations on completing this lesson! You have learned how to set up a Hiro wallet, acquire test STX tokens, and set your network to the Stacks testnet. 

You're now fully prepared to engage with dapps on the Stacks blockchain and deploy your calculator contract to the Stacks testnet. It's time to dive in and start exploring the exciting possibilities that await you!
