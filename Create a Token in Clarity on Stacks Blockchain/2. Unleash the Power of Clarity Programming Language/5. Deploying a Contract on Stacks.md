# Deploying a Contract on Stacks

Welcome back!  So we completed coding Calculator in Clarity. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to learn how to deploy it! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Stacks Explorer Sandbox & deployment

So letâ€™s head over to [Stacks Explorer Sandbox](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/deploy?chain=testnet), a handy tool provided by Stacks Explorer. This tool enables us to interact with contracts and deploy them seamlessly.

So connect your wallet by clicking on the Connect Stacks Wallet button.

Paste the entire code into the Stacks Explorer Sandbox and assign a name to your contract in the contract name field. Letâ€™s name it "calculator":

```jsx
(define-read-only (add (x int) (y int)) int
  (+ x y))

(define-read-only (subtract (x int) (y int))  
  (- x y))

(define-read-only (multiply (x int) (y int))  
  (* x y))

(define-read-only (divide (x int) (y int))  
  (/ x y))
```

Click on the Deploy button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Now copy your address from your Hiro wallet and search for it in the explorer.

Once you initiate the deployment of the "calculator" smart contract, you will notice a pending transaction. It may take approximately 10-15 minutes for this transaction to be confirmed. Please be patient and wait for the confirmation to ensure the successful deployment of the contract.

## Interact with your contract

Once the transaction is confirmed, click on it and copy the contract name. This is your address and contract name.

Then head over to [Stacks Explorer Sandbox](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/contract-call?chain=testnet) for interacting with contracts and paste your address and contract name in the input fields on left side. Then click Get Contract.

You can see the calculator contract that you just deployed! On the right side click on any of the functions of the contract to call them.

Call any function, enter values and it will return a response. Yayyyy!!!
