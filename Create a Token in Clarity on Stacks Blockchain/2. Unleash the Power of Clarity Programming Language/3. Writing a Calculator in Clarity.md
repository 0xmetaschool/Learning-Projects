# Writing a Calculator in Clarity

Welcome back! So we completed learning about Clarity basics. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, we're going to dive into writing our own calculator in Clarity! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Writing the code in Clarity

To write a calculator in Clarity, we will do these steps:

- We will go for four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- We will create functions for each of the operations.

So, we did define the addition function in the last lesson, it was this:

```
(define-read-only (add (x int) (y int)) int
  (+ x y))
```

We will define for the other operations as well:

```
(define-read-only (subtract (x int) (y int))  
  (- x y))

(define-read-only (multiply (x int) (y int))  
  (* x y))
```

## Testing it out

So folks, you must be wondering where can we run our code?

We have got you! You can go to the link of [Clarity Tools](https://clarity.tools/code/hello). Clear all the pre-written code and paste your calculator code there.

Now let’s test these functions by calling them in ClarityTools. The output will be displayed on the left side of the screen in green.

You can use the following test functions: 

```
(add 5 5)
(subtract 10 5)
(multiply 43 3)
```

## Output

The output will be similar to this:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned how to write a calculator in Clarity, including functions for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. We also learned how to test our code using ClarityTools. Congratulations on completing this lesson! With these skills, you are one step closer to becoming a Clarity expert. 

Next, we will learn how to steps our calculator code so stay tuned for the next lesson!
