# What Are We Building Today

gm everyoneðŸŒˆ, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Astar for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own ERC20 token in Solidity programming language and then deploying it on Astar network. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Astar using Solidity.

Letâ€™s look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course.

Why Astar? Astar is a blockchain platform that rivals the Ethereum blockchain. It supports smart contracts written in Solidity programming language to run dApps on its network. Worldâ€™s biggest tech giants, Sony and Toyota, have partnered with Astar network to bring Web3 to masses.

Not only this, Astar has 500k+ community members and 50+ dApps functionally running on it. Astar has a #Build2Earn protocol that allows developers like you to earn a basic income while creating dApps.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Astar blockchain
2. Learn to write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language
3. Set upÂ MetaMask for Astar testnet (Shibuya)
4. Deploy the Solidity smart contract to Astar blockchain

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about Astar blockchain and how they can deploy the smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and Solidity Programming language because in this course we will focus more on writing ERC20 token and deploying it on Astar blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Metamask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your Metamask if you still hasnâ€™t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
