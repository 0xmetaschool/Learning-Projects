# Into the World of Astar

Hello folks, you've just understood what is required to begin this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. Today, that “something new" is the Astar blockchain!

## So, what exactly is Astar?

It’s a super cool platform that has gained popularity as Japan's foremost smart contract platform. It’s a Polkadot-based project that has a great infrastructure which resolves many problems faced by other blockchain (we will discuss those problems in few minutes). 

The support for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machines is what makes Astar unique.

Astar has quickly become the leading parachain in Polkadot ecoystem, hitting more than 50k wallets. Astar Network provides support for infrastructure providers, NFTs marketplaces & projects, DAOs, and much more.

## What problems does Astar solve?

Astar solves big challenges faced by the blockchain ecosystem. Some of them are:

1. Scalability
2. Interoperability
3. Lack of developer incentive

### Scalability

Astar solves the scalability issue by providing the following functionalities:

1. An increased number of transactions per second (TPS)
2. Cheaper transaction costs
3. Faster finality

### Interoperability

Interoperability means that different blockchains can work together smoothly. While there are many blockchains, only a few have the ability to work together easily. Astar is among those few, designed to work seamlessly with Polkadot.

### Lack of developer incentive

DApp developers have to spend a lot of money to create DApps or any blockchain related project. 

Astar has a special #Build2Earn system that lets developers earn a basic income while they're busy creating their products. You can explore more [here](https://astar.network/).

## Astar language and currency

Astar support for EVM and WASM virtual machines allow it to support Solidity, C/C++, Go, TypeScript, Java, and Rust. In this course, I will explain how you can create a token in Solidity and deploy it to Astar virtual EVM machine.

ASTR is the native token in the Astar blockchain, and it is used in the mainnet, which is expensive for us to work with. Therefore, in this course, you will work with SBY token, which is the testnet token used in the Shibuya, the testnet network of Astar blockchain.

## That’s a wrap

Astar’s unique behaviour of supporting different virtual machines is what makes it unique and standout from other blockchains.

In the next lesson, we will set up the environment for writing our own contract in Solidity on the Astar blockchain.
