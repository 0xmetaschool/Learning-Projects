# Setup MetaMask Using Astar Portal

Welcome back!  So you completed learning about Astar. Awesome, you did great! Well, get ready because in this lesson, you're going to learn how to set up the dev environment for running your code. You will set up MetaMask and Remix now! Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Development environment

You now need a super cool environment to run your code in and you need to set it up!

For this course, you will setup MetaMask using the Astar portal. You will set the MetaMask with Shibuya network (Shibuya is a testnet for Astar blockchain) and use chaindrop that offers faucet tokens for different testnets to fill your wallet with tokens. Don’t worry, setting them up is super easy and you will do it no time! 

Lastly, you will create a Solidity file in Remix IDE which you will use to compile and deploy your token contract.

## Setup MetaMask

I assume you have already installed MetaMask in your system. Now, I will walk you through setting up the Shibuya testnet in your MetaMask wallet.

### Steps

1. Head over to [https://portal.astar.network/](https://portal.astar.network/) and click on the “Astar | Connected” button present at top right corner of the screen.

    The following screen will appear after you click on it.

2. Notice “Shibuya Network” on the screen? Select it and click on “Connect button.”

    After connecting to Shibuya network, the button showing “Astar | Connected” will now show “Shibuya | Connected”. Something like this:

3. Next, click on “MetaMask” button and follow the connection process to add Shibuya network to your MetaMask wallet.
    1. First of all, click on “Next” and “Connect” bottoms, buttons to confirm the connection with MetaMask.
    2. Then, click on “Sign”, “Approve”, and “Switch Network” to switch to the Shibuya network.

## Fill your account with SBY

You must have noticed that SBY plays the role of token in Shibuya network. Next we will fill our newly created Shibuya account with SBY using faucet. Here’s how you can do that:

### Steps

1. First of all, head over to your MetaMask and copy your Shibuya account address.

2. Head over to the following faucet: [https://chaindrop.org/?chainid=80001&token=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee](https://chaindrop.org/?chainid=80001&token=0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) 
2. Select Shibuya network from the scroll bar.
3. Paste your Shibuya network account address in the input bar.
4. Click on “I am human” box and fill the captcha.
5. At last, click on “send me” button.

Let’s look at how I did the same process. It will help you understand better.

In next 3-5 minutes your wallet will be filled with 0.1 SBY. 🎊

## Setup Remix

Head over to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and click on “New File” button. Set the name of your file as `MyScooby.sol`.

That’s pretty much it for now!

## That’s a wrap

In next lesson, you will write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language.
