Polygon is an L2 or [Layer 2](https://metaschool.so/articles/layer-1-blockchain/) scaling solution for Ethereum. It helps reduces cost, improves scalability and speed by acting as a child chain to the Ethereum Blockchain.

MATIC, which is used to control and secure the network, is Polygon's native token. Users can communicate with the hundreds of dApps that make up the Polygon ecosystem using this currency.
