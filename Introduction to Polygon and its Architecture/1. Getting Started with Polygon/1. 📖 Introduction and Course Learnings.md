Hey fam, 

Aswin here 👋🏼 

This course will make you ready for the Polygon ecosystem from the theory end… which is soops important. Let's start with the origins.

Jayant Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun established the open-source decentralized blockchain network Polygon, originally known as the Matic network, in 2017.

Polygon is an L2 or [Layer 2](https://metaschool.so/articles/layer-1-blockchain/) scaling solution for Ethereum. It helps reduces cost, improves scalability and speed by acting as a child chain to the Ethereum Blockchain.

MATIC, which is used to control and secure the network, is Polygon's native token. Users can communicate with the hundreds of dApps that make up the Polygon ecosystem using this currency.
