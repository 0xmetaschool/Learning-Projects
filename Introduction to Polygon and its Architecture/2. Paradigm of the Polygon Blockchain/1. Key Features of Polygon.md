# Key Features of Polygon

The most interesting part about Polygon is its paradigm, first let's talk about its key features.

Here's also a pretty cool visual to refer to during the lesson.

## 1\. Polygon is a Proof of Stake blockchain technology i.e. a consensus algorithm based on which the whole network works

Proof-of-stake protocols are a group of blockchain consensus algorithms that choose validators based on how much of the linked cryptocurrency they own. This is done to circumvent [proof-of-work](https://metaschool.so/articles/proof-of-work-meaning/) techniques' high computational costs.

## 2\. Polygon is not a sidechain but a [plasma chain](https://metaschool.so/articles/plasma-chain-ethereum-blockchain/) to the Ethereum Network

A plasma chain is a unique blockchain that is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet but runs transactions off-chain and has its own system for validating blocks. Plasma chains, which are effectively scaled-down versions of the Ethereum Mainnet, are frequently referred to as "child" chains.

## 3\. Polygon solves Ethereumâ€™s low transaction speed as well as high computational power problem

Polygon network can scale up to 65K transactions per second

## 4\. Polygon supports EVM, that is you can write your smart contracts using Solidity

After each new block is added to the chain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, also known as the EVM, computes the state of the Ethereum network and executes smart contracts. The hardware layer and node network layer of Ethereum are on top of the EVM. Furthermore, Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms.

## 5\. The validators of the Polygon Network are also stakers on the network

So basically, every [validator](https://metaschool.so/articles/validator-blockchain/) will have to be a good player to avoid any penalty [on their stake](https://metaschool.so/articles/staking-proof-of-stake/).

## 6\. Polygon support gas-less NFT minting

This is a great feature for someone who wants to get into the NFT space at a minimal cost.

## 7\. There are more than 37K dApps on Polygon

A wide range of dApps are available for you to build around for interoperability.

Cool and easy start, right?

It's going to get cooler now. Let's move to the next lesson - but before that, let's answer the question below and get it right.
