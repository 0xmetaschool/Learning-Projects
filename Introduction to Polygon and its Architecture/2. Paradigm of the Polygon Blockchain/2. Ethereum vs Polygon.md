# Ethereum vs Polygon

Before I start explaining the need of Polygon Blockchain especially when something like Ethereum is around, we should outline some key differences between the two blockchains. Here's something I made for you üëáüèº

| Polygon                                                 | Ethereum                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Polygon is a Layer 2 blockchain network                 | Ethereum is a Layer 1 blockchain network                    |
| A Layer 2 blockchain network acts as a child to Layer 1 | Layer 1 is the base blockchain network and acts as a parent |
| 65,000 TPS                                              | 13-15 TPS                                                   |

p.s. TPS refers to Transactions Per Second.

And here's how the child chain and parent chain part works out.

So, why does Ethereum need a scaling solution?

Ethereum 1.0 had a transaction speed of 13-15 transactions per second and this was not sufficient for global scaling that‚Äôs why Ethereum needed scaling solutions and Polygon came into play.

## Types of scaling solutions

- **Sharding**: This entails breaking the chain state into smaller units, referred to as shards. Therefore, all transactions that started inside of a shard must be processed by the nodes present there. Therefore, the network as a whole can be improved by reducing the number of nodes. That's what [sharding](https://metaschool.so/articles/sharding-meaning/) is!
  Eg: It work exactly like Hadoop, suppose you have 100 TB of data and so you divide the data into 10 parts each having 10 TB on certain conditions like the category so now when you are looking for a particular data rather than spending time on the 100 TB data you can look for the particular part which is only 10 TB thus increasing your efficiency by 10X

- **State Chain**: In this approach, the process that is being worked on right now has priority, while the other operation is moved off-chain. The only thing sent to the main chain is the evidence.¬†  
  Example: it works like an outsourcing model where you receive a project from your client but rather than doing it all by yourself, you outsource a certain part of your work from a third-party company and that company will send the completed work to you.

- **Plasma**: [Plasma is an off-chain scaling strategy](https://metaschool.so/articles/plasma-chain-ethereum-blockchain/) that mostly interacts with the off-chain and has little to no impact on the main chain.

I think that's enough to outline the differences and also the need of Polygon as a blockchain. Now let's move to the next lesson where we will understand its role as a plasma chain, a type of L2 scaling solution.
