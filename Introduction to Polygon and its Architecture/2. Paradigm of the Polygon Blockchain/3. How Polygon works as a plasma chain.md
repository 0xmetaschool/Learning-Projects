# How Polygon works as a plasma chain

Now this is one of the most important lessons in the course, since we will understand Polygon's role as a plasma chain and how it helps with scaling the Ethereum ecosystem.

Polygon is a [plasma chain](https://metaschool.so/articles/plasma-chain-ethereum-blockchain/) which means it helps Ethereum with off-chain computation.

In that situation, Polygon will act as a child chain and verify the transaction on its node and report back to Ethereum, the parent chain, periodically and settle any dispute. Pretty much like how courts work.

Smart contracts and Merkle Trees are used to create the Plasma structure, which enables the production of an infinite number of child chains—basically, scaled-down versions of the parent Ethereum blockchain. Each chain is intended to function in a distinct manner, meeting various needs through coexistence and independent operation. More chains may be constructed on top of each child chain, which is how a tree-like structure is created.

Fraud proofs make it possible to make deposits and withdrawals of monies from the plasma chain during state transitions.

Example: Suppose you are the owner of the company XY (Polygon), which is a subsidiary of company ABC (Ethereum). Now XY has 100 paying customers, so XY will provide the product faster (Higher TPS) and with minimum cost of delivery (low transaction fee). This is because XY deals particularly on that product and all its employees are trained for that product but ABC has so many products under them. Due to this, XY will collect all the money from its customers and periodically report its balance sheet of transactions (Root of Merkle’s tree) to its parent company ABC.

So XY is a separate business and it serves a set of customers thus offloading the stress from its parent company ABC (off-chain computation) and XY validates its own transaction and periodically submits the balance sheet of transaction to its parent company ABC.

Let's move to the next lesson where we will understand the core components of Polygon Blockchain.
