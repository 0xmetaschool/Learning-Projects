# Important products of Polygon

We have learned a lot about the core internal components which makes up the Polygon Blockchain.

But there are are certain polygon products which interoperate with the Polygon Blockchain to make up the whole ecosystem.

I'd love to walk you through them and give you a clear understanding. Let's go üëáüèº

## Polygon Wallet

Polygon Wallet is a non custodial web wallet which allows users to send/receive the crypto assets, stake MATIC and also access the Polygon Bridge. Note: Any ERC-20 compatible wallet can hold MATIC.

## Polygon Bridge

Polygon Bridge acts a trustless path back and forth between the Ethereum Chain and the Polygon Chain. Users can quickly send their funds back and forth with a compatible wallet.

And that's all folks

I hope I could teach you some of the core concepts of the Polygon Blockchain and that you've learned something new.

Congratulations to you! üéâ

In upcoming courses you will learn about building dApps on Polygon - hope you are excited because it's worth getting excited for.

These concepts are very important when you are building your dApp on Polygon because now you know the core properties which are needed to consider when building on an ecosystem like Polygon. These concepts will also be beneficial for your interviews, so hold and grab onto them and practice them again and again if you want.

A great tip to grasp concepts like these is to write some small notes on Twitter, I've found they can be helpful. Once your friends like the information you share, you get that extra boost of confidence and it just helps you remember better tbh. Don't forget to tag us @0xmetaschool if you do post something.
