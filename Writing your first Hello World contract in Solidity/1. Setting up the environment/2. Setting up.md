# Setting up

Let’s get to setting up the environment first.

1. We will install and set up our metamask account.
2. We will setup metamask with Sepolia network


## Creating MetaMask wallet

Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

MetaMask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use MetaMask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let’s go!

Here are the installation steps:

- Go to [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/)
- Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
- Setup your secure password.
- The next step is the most important one.
- Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

Now we need to setup our metamask with the Sepolia RPC so let's go get that,

## First, What is a RPC?
So RPC is like a communication to blockchain which allows you to read/write on the blockchain, in short, a RPC is like a communication gateway for any blockchain

I hope that's clear for you so let's go and add this RPC to our metamask.

Let's go to [Metaschool RPC for Sepolia](https://metaschool.so/rpc/sepolia)

Click on "add to metamask" and confirm the transaction and that's it SEPOLIA is added to your metamask

So, we have finished setting up metamask for our token, now let’s get some free ETH tokens to pay for the transaction fees.

## Let’s get some FREE ETH Tokens🤑🤑🤑🤑

We will be using Testnet environment to create our own tokens.

For every transaction on blockchain, we need a native token of that blockchain, since we are building on Ethereum chain, we will need ETH tokens. So let’s get some fake money.

- Now go to [https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
- Sign in with your metamask wallet
- Now you will see an option to request LINK token and ETH token on Sepolia network, Make sure to select ETH token out of the two
- After this login with your Twitter to verify yourself
- Finally you need to complete the Captcha and click on send request

## Get your private 🦊 MetaMask key

Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export private it and paste it somewhere secure. DON’T COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON’T SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!
