# Setting up

Welcome back! Folks we have a lot to set up before starting our project. But don’t worry, I’ve got you! Just follow the steps and you will be all ready!

Let’s get to setting up the environment:

1. We will install and set up our Metamask account.
2. We will set up the Sepolia testnet environment.
3. We will fetch some fake money.
4. We will set up Hardhat project.
5. We will set up environment variables.

## Creating MetaMask wallet

Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

MetaMask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use MetaMask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let’s go!

Here are the installation steps:

- Go to [MetaMask.io](https://metamask.io/)
- Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
- Setup your secure password.
- The next step is the most important one.
- Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

### Setting up the testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://metaschool.so/rpc/sepolia](https://metaschool.so/rpc/sepolia).
- Click on first “Add to Metamask” button. Pointed out the button in following image.

- Click on "Approve" and then "Switch Network" button.

You will be successfully connected to Sepolia network. See in the following gif how I did it where my wallet is already connected. Don't worry about the UI, the “Add to Metamask” button will work the same.

Note: My MetaMask is already connected that’s why you won’t see the "Approve" MetaMask button in this GIF.

## Get some fake Sepolia ETH $$

You can follow the steps given below:

1. Head over to the site: [https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).
2. Select both "Drips 250 LINK" and "Drips 0.1 ETH" boxes.
3. Click on the "Continue" button to continue.

4. Paste your wallet address to the given fields, fill in the captha, and click "Continue with GitHub" button.
5. Authenticate your GitHub.

6. At last, click on the "Get tokens" button.
![faucet-3](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets%20for%20Writing%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20contract%20in%20Solidity/Setting%20up/faucet-2.png?raw=true)

After waiting for some time, you will receive 0.1 Sepolia ETH.

## Set up HardHat project

First make a project directory where you will work and we will install all the dependencies and hardhat there.

Now open your terminal and run the following commands one by one. Just copy and paste one by one.

```
mkdir Hello-World
cd Hello-World
npm install --save-dev hardhat@2.20.0
```

The above commands means that you created a `Hello-World` folder - an empty one. You entered that folder and initialised the project by making a `package.json` file. Then you installed hardhat in the same folder.

If you have followed the instructions properly, and everything went according to the plan, you have HardHat installed. 🎉

Now write the following command on the terminal.

```
npx hardhat init
```

You will see something like this.

![HardHat-output.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets%20for%20Writing%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20contract%20in%20Solidity/Setting%20up/HardHat-output.png?raw=true)

Please follow the guide and create a JavaScript project. Just follow through the questions and answer them yes. For me it was something like below:

![HardHat-output-2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets%20for%20Writing%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20contract%20in%20Solidity/Setting%20up/hardhat-output-2.png?raw=true)

You need to install some more dependencies; `hardhat ether`. Hardhat ethers is a plugin that gives us access to `ethers.js` library. `ethers.js` library gives us a way to interact with the blockchain world, we can deploy contracts, we can fetch contracts, we can call their functions, all thanks to this library.

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers --force
```

Lastly, run the following command on safe side to ensure that all required installations are done:

```
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox --force
```

**Side tip : Install [Solidity Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) by Juan Blanco in VScode to help with syntax and coding error issues.**

## Project structure

Let’s open your project in VSCode or Sublime or any other IDE your prefer. The structure will look something like this. I personally and millions of other devs prefer VSCode. You can even install a Solidity extension there.

![Frame 3560339 (1).png](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets%20for%20Writing%20your%20first%20Hello%20World%20contract%20in%20Solidity/Setting%20up/Frame_3560339_(1).png?raw=true>)

The contracts directory will have all the contracts for the project and scripts directory will have all the deployments scripts and other stuff related to the project.

## That’s a wrap

Great work on setting up your first HardHat project. 🎊 Next, you will start writing your first Hello World Solidity contract and learn how it is working. So hang in there and keep on learning.
