# Setting up the environment

## **🔮 The Basics**

Heya folks! I am Fama and today I will be helping you write your first ever solidity contract. Not only this, there is much more fun stuff we will be doing during this project. So be excited and please bring your A game here.  
  
We will cover some  
  
1. Super cool tools that you need to interact with as a smart contract developer.  
2. Writing your first ever solidity contract.  
3. Shipping it to testnet and thennnn, interacting with it too. 🔥🔥  
4. And understanding transactions on blockchain.

Please install VScode and node on your machine. Install [node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download [VScode from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
