# What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone 🌈, I am [Fama](https://twitter.com/fatimarizwan) from Metaschool. I am very excited to bring the very new exciting course for developers just like you, who want to get started with the blockchain ecosystem!

So what are we building today? Today I will be helping you write your first ever solidity contract. Not only this, there is much more fun stuff we will be doing during this project. So be excited and please bring your A game here.

Why Solidity? Because many of the popular blockchains, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Binance Smart Chain (BSC)](https://bscscan.com/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) etc uses Solidity programming language to write smart contracts. Not only blockchains, but some of the biggest projects in web3 ecosystem, [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Compound](https://compound.finance/), [Yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance/) etc are in Solidity programming language.

Not only this, the Solidity docs have 580k visits per month and 2.15 pages per visit and almost 270k active Solidity developers per month. Yep! Solidity is the new hot thing in the developers community and Metaschool wants you to get ahead of 90% developers.
