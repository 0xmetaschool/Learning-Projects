# Writing Deployment Script

Great work on creating your first Solidity contract. In this lesson, you will write the deployment script for your Solidity contract and deploy it on the Sepolia network.

## Deploy script

Now is the time to write the deployment script. Now, we will create a `deploy.js` file in the `scripts` folder and this file will contain all the logic for deployment.

```
async function main() {
  const HelloWorld = await ethers.getContractFactory("HelloWorld");
  console.log("Deploying Contract...");
  const helloWorld = await HelloWorld.deploy("Hello World! Bingo");
  const deployedContract = await helloWorld.waitForDeployment();
  const contractAddress = await deployedContract.getAddress();
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", contractAddress);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

**Booooooommmmmmmm!!! 🚀 We are ready for deployment.**

First, run the following command to compile the smart contract

```
npx hardhat compile
```

You’ll get the following output.

```
Downloading compiler 0.8.9
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully
```

Now, run the script file using the following command.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

When you deploy your contract, you might see a warning related to ‘zodiac sign’ parameter being unused, let’s ignore that for now. We will get to it laterrrrr.

If all goes well, your contract will be deployed and you will be able to see the address of the contract on the terminal. **🔮 Copy that and save in your `.env` file with variable name as `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, we will use it later to interact with the contract.**

Now your `.env` file should look something like this.

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

```

Congratulations!! Congratulations!! Congratulations!!

Your contract is deployed. 🚀

## Explore your contract

A cool thing you can do right now is go to [sepolia.etherscan.io](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and copy paste your contract address and read more about it.

🔥 Etherscan is **a website to help you view data regarding any pending or confirmed Ethereum blockchain transactions.** Since Ethereum is a public, open blockchain, whenever anyone interacts with it the action is recorded into the transaction history and it is open for anyone to see.

## That’s a wrap

Boom! your `HelloWorld` contract is deployed to the local chain.
