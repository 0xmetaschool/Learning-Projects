# Claim the AirDrop Module

Awesome folks! So far, you have deployed the QRC20 token and AirDrop module. Now, in this lesson, you will learn to claim the AirDrop module. Basically, you will write code for Merkle Proof. Remember, we learned Merkle Proof at the start of the section? We will implement it now. We will check whether the address that is calling the claim file is the part of Merkle tree or not.

## Let’s start coding.

Navigate to `scripts/AirDropV1/3_claim.js` and start writing the following code.

### Add necessary modules

Let’s start with importing some necessary modules. You have already used them in last lesson. So, we will move forward without explaining them here again.

```
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const keccak256 = require("keccak256");
const { MerkleTree } = require("merkletreejs");
web3 = require('web3');
const fs = require("fs");
```

### Start with `main()` function

Again, we will start with creating the an async `main` function.

```
async function main() {
	// Rest of the code goes here
}
main();
```

After ending the `main()`, I called it simply adding the `main();` line.

From now on, we will add the code inside of the main function. As `main` function will contain all of the necessary code.

### Import AirDrop contract

At the start of the `main` function, we will first import the `AirDropV1` contract using the contract address we got in the last lesson.

```
// Define the address of the deployed Airdrop contract
const Airdrop = "YOUR-AIRDROP-CONTRACT-ADDRESS";
// Get the Contract Factory for the Airdrop contract
const Airdrop_fac = await ethers.getContractFactory("AirDropV1");
// Attach the Contract instance to the deployed Airdrop contract
const contract = Airdrop_fac.attach(Airdrop);
```

- First, we’re filling the contract address with the address we got after deploying the `AirDropV1` module. Copy-paste it to the `Airdrop` constant variable.
- Then, we’re using `getContractFactory` function to get the `AirDropV1` contract factory.
- At last, we’re attaching the contract factory with our deployed contract address to create an instance of the contract that we can interact with.

### Get the caller address

Next, we need to fetch the address of the person who is actually calling this script file (`3_claim.js`). He’s the one who we need to check whether belongs to Merkle tree or not.

```
// Get the signer accounts (Ethereum addresses with signing capabilities)
const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();
// Get the Ethereum address of the caller (claimer)
const claimAddress = accounts[0].address; 
```

- First, We use the `ethers` library to obtain a list of signer accounts that can sign transactions.
- Then, we extract the address of the caller (claimer) from the list of signer accounts, which will always be at 0th index.

### Parse Merkle Tree and create new one

We will read and parse the Merkle tree data. But where is it? You must have noticed that when you ran the deployment script for AirDropV1 module, the JSON file named `tree.json` was created. This file contains all of the data of Merkle tree. Let me show you the project directory to make this more clear.

![project-directory.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/3.%20Creating%20and%20Deploying%20a%20Gamer%20DAO%20using%20Q%20GDK/7.%20Claim%20the%20AirDrop%20Module/project-directory.webp?raw=true)

Now, we will read the data, parse it, and extract the leaf nodes data from it.

```
// Read and parse Merkle tree data from the 'tree.json' file
const jsonData = fs.readFileSync('tree.json', 'utf-8');
const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
const leafNodes = data.leafNodes.map((node) => Buffer.from(node, 'hex'));
// Create a Merkle tree from the leaf nodes
const merkleTree = new MerkleTree(leafNodes, keccak256, { sortPairs: true });
```

- Here, first line simply reads the JSON file, `tree.json`.
- Second line parse the `jsonData` and store it in `data` constant.
- Then, we extract the leaf nodes data (user addresses in hexadecimal format) from the parsed JSON data and convert them to Buffer objects.
- At last, we create new Merkle Tree using the leaf nodes, using the `MerkleTree` class from the `merkletreejs` library.
- The `keccak256` hashing function is used to hash the leaf nodes.
- The `{ sortPairs: true }` option ensures that the pairs of nodes are sorted before hashing.

### Print Merkle Tree

Printing the Merkle Tree will help you visualize how actually the Merkle Tree looks like. So, let’s do that and have a glimpse of accomplishment.

```
// Display the Merkle tree structure
console.log("---------");
console.log("Merkle Tree");
console.log("---------");
console.log(merkleTree.toString());
```

### Generate Merkle Proofs

Here, we’re generating Merkle proofs for all the leaf nodes using the `getHexProof` function using the `merkleTree` instance.

```
// Generate Merkle proofs for all leaf nodes
const proofArray = leafNodes.map((node) =>
  merkleTree.getHexProof(node)
);
```

### Claim AirDrop

Now, we will write the main part of our code. We will go through each hexadecimal code generated for each leaf node and check if the caller address is whitelisted or not.

```
// Initialize a flag to track whether the airdrop has been claimed
let isClaimed = false;
// Loop through each proof and attempt to claim airdrop
for (let i = 0; i < proofArray.length; i++) {
  // Check if the caller's address is whitelisted for this proof
  const isWhitelisted = await contract.isWhitelistedUser(claimAddress, proofArray[i]);
  
  // If whitelisted, claim the airdrop reward
  if (isWhitelisted) {
    await contract.claimReward(claimAddress, proofArray[i]);
    console.log("Claimed Airdrop for address:", claimAddress);
    isClaimed = true; // Set the flag to true
    break; // Exit the loop
  }
}
```

- First, we set up a flag `isClaimed` and initialize it as `false`. We use this flag to check whether the `claimAddress` is whitelisted address or not.
- Then, we loop through each proof in the `proofArray` and check if the caller's address is whitelisted for that proof using the `isWhitelistedUser` function from the contract.
- If the caller is whitelisted, we claim the airdrop reward by calling the `claimReward` function from the contract with the caller's address and the proof.
- We print a message indicating that the airdrop has been claimed for the caller's address.
- If the caller address is whitelisted, we set the `isClaimed` flag to `true` and break out of the loop.

### Check flag

If the `isClaimed` flag is still `false` after the loop, it means the caller's address wasn't whitelisted for any of the proofs. In this case, we print a message indicating that the caller is not a whitelisted user.

```
// If the airdrop was not claimed, print a message
if (!isClaimed) {
  console.log("Not a whitelisted user.");
}
```

## Complete code

Here’s how the complete code looks like.

```
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const keccak256 = require("keccak256");
const { MerkleTree } = require("merkletreejs");
web3 = require('web3');
const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
	// Define the address of the deployed Airdrop contract
	const Airdrop = "YOUR-AIRDROP-CONTRACT-ADDRESS";
	// Get the Contract Factory for the Airdrop contract
	const Airdrop_fac = await ethers.getContractFactory("AirDropV1");
	// Attach the Contract instance to the deployed Airdrop contract
	const contract = Airdrop_fac.attach(Airdrop);

	// Get the signer accounts (Ethereum addresses with signing capabilities)
	const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();
	// Get the Ethereum address of the caller (claimer)
	const claimAddress = accounts[0].address;

	// Read and parse Merkle tree data from the 'tree.json' file
	const jsonData = fs.readFileSync('tree.json', 'utf-8');
	const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
	const leafNodes = data.leafNodes.map((node) => Buffer.from(node, 'hex'));
	// Create a Merkle tree from the leaf nodes
	const merkleTree = new MerkleTree(leafNodes, keccak256, { sortPairs: true });

	// Display the Merkle tree structure
	console.log("---------");
	console.log("Merkle Tree");
	console.log("---------");
	console.log(merkleTree.toString());

	// Generate Merkle proofs for all leaf nodes
	const proofArray = leafNodes.map((node) =>
	  merkleTree.getHexProof(node)
	);

	console.log("Claiming Airdrop");

	// Initialize a flag to track whether the airdrop has been claimed
	let isClaimed = false;
	// Loop through each proof and attempt to claim airdrop
	for (let i = 0; i < proofArray.length; i++) {
	  // Check if the caller's address is whitelisted for this proof
	  const isWhitelisted = await contract.isWhitelistedUser(claimAddress, proofArray[i]);
	  
	  // If whitelisted, claim the airdrop reward
	  if (isWhitelisted) {
	    await contract.claimReward(claimAddress, proofArray[i]);
	    console.log("Claimed Airdrop for address:", claimAddress);
	    isClaimed = true; // Set the flag to true
	    break; // Exit the loop
	  }
	}

	// If the airdrop was not claimed, print a message
  if (!isClaimed) {
    console.log("Not a whitelisted user.");
  }

}
// Call the main function to initiate the airdrop claiming process
main();
```

**Note:** Don't forget to replace `"YOUR-AIRDROP-CONTRACT-ADDRESS"`, with your AirDrop contract address. 

## Let’s run the script

After updating the addresses, run the following command to run the `3_claim.js` script file.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/AirDropV1/3_claim.js --network testnet
```

This command will give you the output like this:

![claim-output.webp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/3.%20Creating%20and%20Deploying%20a%20Gamer%20DAO%20using%20Q%20GDK/7.%20Claim%20the%20AirDrop%20Module/claim-output.webp)

## That’s a wrap

In summary, this script essentially automates the process of checking if a caller's address is whitelisted for any of the provided proofs and claiming the AirDrop reward if eligible.

From next section, we will implement the more advanced version of this basic AirDrop module, which will be integrated into the DAO and be managed fully decentralized without the module deployer having to control it.and then deploy it using different deployment scripts.
