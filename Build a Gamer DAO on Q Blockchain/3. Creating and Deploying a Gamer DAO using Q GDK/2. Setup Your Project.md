# Setup Your Hardhat Project

Greetings folks! You have been doing so awesome. Till now we discussed about understanding the concepts, and implementing them. 

In this section, we will follow along the following steps:

1. Setup our project
2. Create your native DAO token
3. Build DAO using Q DAO Factory
4. Add AirDrop Module to your DAO

So what are you waiting for? Let’s start setting up our hardhat project.

## Prerequisites

First, we need a few installations so make sure you have the following on your machine:

- A code editor (we are using [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).)
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (Please make sure to install `v18` for this project. We are using `v18.17.1`. It is important to use the appropriate version to avoid facing errors.)
- [Install GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

## Clone the boilerplate Hardhat project

To save you some work, we created a npm project with Hardhat configuration files. Open the terminal and run the following command to clone the GitHub repository. 

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Q-boilerplate-code.git
```

Now, run the following command to move to the repository folder and install all dependencies:

```
cd Q-boilerplate-code
npm install dotenv --save --force
npm install --save-dev hardhat --force
npm install --force
```
When you install the dependencies, you will receive different warnings. Please ignore those warnings and move forward. Here is an example output of the `npm install --force` command.

**Note:** If you are planning to not use the boilerplate project and create your own Hardhat project, please make sure that you are using same config file and copying other important files from `contracts` folder.

## Update `.env` file

To deploy scripts on the blockchain, you will need to use a private key from your wallet. To do this, you can fetch your private key from one of your accounts in Metamask Q network (we recommend creating a new account for this). To get the private key:

- Click on your account.
- Click on “Account details”.
- Click on “Show Private Key”.
- Enter your Metamask wallet password.
- Copy the private key shown.

Now, navigate to `.env` in your main folder (`Q-boilerplate-code`) with the following content. Replace `“ENTER_YOUR_KEY”` with the private key of your wallet that you copied.

```
PRIVATE_KEY="ENTER_YOUR_KEY"
```

## That’s a wrap

You are all set to start your project. Next, we will start adding the code to it. Our first task would be to create a token that will be a native token for our DAO. So let’s move to the next steps.
