# How Does Q Blockchain Work?

Awesome job for learning about Q Blockchain and the history of the blockchain ecosystem. In this lesson, we will look into how the Q Blockchain actually works.

## Pillars of the Q Protocol

The Q Protocol is built on three important pillars, which build a strong foundation:

- **Constitute**: Think of the Q Constitution as the set of rules that everyone follows in the Q economy. They’re like a fair playing field that everyone agrees to. These rules help create a foundation for everyone on Q to build and work together.
- **Enforce**: In Q system, everyone follows rules and resolutions. These rules are  written down in the Q Constitution. To make sure everyone follows the rules, Q has two seperate types of nodes in the network called root nodes and validators. The validators run the blockchain, while the root nodes enforce the rules and make sure that they’re followed.
- **Resolve**: Sometimes, there are disagreements or problems between the participants (like validators and Q token holders). In those cases, Q has integrated dispute resolution into the system. It allows participants to make a case before the International Chamber of Commerce, Court of Arbitration (ICC) who makes a fair judgment to resolve these disputes when the rules don't provide a clear answer. The ICC decision can be then implemented on the blockchain by the root nodes.

**All three pillars** include both on-chain and off-chain blockchain parts. On-chain means the things that happen directly on the Q blockchain, and off-chain means the things that happen “in real live”, so basically in our traditional world. The enforcement is crucial to make sure the rules are respected and followed properly.

## What are the main elements of the Q Protocol?

Lets look at the main components of the Q Protocol, which play an essential part in the Q architecture using the following diagram:

## How does the Q Blockchain work?

So you have gone through the main points. Now lets explain everything using easy words and understand how Q Blockchain works:

- **Governance framework:** Q Blockchain has a strong governance framework that all participants in the system agree upon. The governance framework is the structure holding all elements and stakeholders to keep things organized.
- **Q constitution:** The Q Constitution is the rulebook for the system. It lays down all the important rules that need to be followed, but it als describes the decision making process in Q and who is involved. It's enforced effectively within the Q governance framework.
- **Validator nodes:** Validator nodes are like special computers that maintain the Q ledger, which is a record of all the transactions happening on the blockchain. There are limited positions for validator nodes, and they are given to candidates who have staked the highest number of Q Tokens. It's like a competition to become a validator node!
    - The distribution of these positions is automatic, continuous, and anonymous. This means that anyone who has enough Q Tokens can become a validator node without needing anyone's permission. It's open for anyone to participate.
- **Token holders:** Q Token Holders have the power to delegate their Q Tokens to validator nodes. By doing this, they can earn rewards for helping improve the governance and decentralization of the Q Blockchain. It's a way to support the system and get rewarded for it.
    - Q Token Holders can also make proposals and vote on them. This means they have a say in how things are decided within the blockchain. It's about having a voice and being able to contribute to the decision-making process.
- **Root nodes:** Root nodes are guardians of the integrity of the Q Blockchain. They make sure that validator nodes are doing their job correctly and following the Q Constitution. This helps maintain fairness and security within the system.
- **Dispute resolution mechanism:** Q Blockchain has a dispute resolution mechanism that's fully integrated into the consensus and governance framework. This ensures that the root nodes act in compliance with the Q Constitution, protecting the rights of participants. It's about having a system in place to solve problems and keep everything in order without having one central authority controlling everything.

## That’s a wrap

So, there are a few elements to the Q Blockchain, like having rules that everyone agrees upon, using validator nodes to maintain the ledger, allowing token holders to delegate and participate in governance, and having root nodes to ensure everything is fair and in compliance with the rules.

In next lesson, you will dive into what actually DAOs are and understand why you are going to build a DAO on Q Blockchain.
