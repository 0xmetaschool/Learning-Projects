# Connect the DAO to the Frontend

Welcome back! It’s so exciting to see you build your own DAO on Q blockchain and finally you are at the last stage of the course where you will be connecting your DAO to the frontend. 

## Run the frontend

First, clone this repository [https://github.com/0xmetaschool/build-a-gamer-dao-q-boilerplate](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/build-a-gamer-dao-q-boilerplate) which contains the frontend using the following command. Remember to clone the frontend outside of the `Q-boilerplate-code` folder (Your HardHat project folder).

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/build-a-gamer-dao-q-boilerplate
```

Now run the following command to go to the root folder of the frontend:

```
cd build-a-gamer-dao-q-boilerplate
```

Next, let’s install `yarn` first using npm:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Then we will install dependencies using the following command:

```
yarn install
```

After the frontend is installed, let’s run the frontend using the following command:

```
yarn start
```

You can view your frontend on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

## Connect your DAO to frontend

Next, connect to your wallet by clicking “Connect Wallet”. (Make sure your Metamask is connected to Q Testnet.)

Remember the `DAO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` you have copied in the lesson “Build DAO Using the Q DAO Factory”. Paste it to the search DAO field to connect to your DAO. Once you are done, you would have successfully connected your DAO to the frontend and now you can interact with your DAO.

We will need the DAO Token Supply present on the Dashboard of the DAO. Copy it for now.

## Let’s create a AirDropV2 proposal

Now since we have connected our DAO to the frontend, let’s create a AirDropV2 proposal which will create an airdrop campaign and the DAO members can vote for or against the campaign. Once the campaign is passed and executed, the whitelisted addresses will be able to claim the DAO token exactly like we did for AirDropV1.

### Increase your voting power

Before moving forward you need to make sure your voting power is not zero. To check your voting power, go to "Voting Power" from the side bar and check "Voting Power" option.

![voting-power.jpeg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/5.1.%20Connect%20the%20DAO%20to%20the%20Frontend/voting-power.webp?raw=true)

If your voting power is zero and your address balance is also zero. First of all, you need to mint some tokens from the dashboard, same as we did in the Q DAO.

1. Go to "Dashboard" which is the 2nd option on your left panel.
2. Click on the three dots in the 2nd block.
3. Click on "Mint tokens" option. You will see this option only if the DAO you are using is your own creation. If you are using anyone else's DAO, ask them to fund you some tokens.
4. Enter the amount of token you want to mint. Do enter more than 10% of available tokens.

Here's a GIF for your ease.

Now, to increase your total voting weight, follow the steps given below:

1. Go to “Voting Power” which is the 2nd option on your left panel.
2. Click on “Max” in the **Deposit** tab and then click Deposit.
3. Approve the transaction.
4. Again click on “Max” in the **Deposit** tab and then click Deposit.
5. Approve the transaction and verify your Total Voting Weight has increased.

Here's a GIF for your ease.

### Create proposal

After funding, go to Governance (3rd option on left panel) and then click on “Create proposal”:

After clicking on “Create proposal”, follow the steps given below:

1. Select AirDropV2 as proposal type and click on Next.
2. The reward token address is the DAO Token Supply on the Dashboard of the DAO. We copied it before so paste it here.
3. The reward amount is the amount of token needed to be airdropped per user. Currently, it is autofilled to 1, you can change it however you want it to.
4. For the next step, you need two addresses, make sure to have them. I am using one mine and other of a friend. Add address and then click “Add Address”, add another address and click “Add Address”.
5. Click on “Next”.
6. Click on “Submit” to submit the transaction. See the following gif where I have followed all steps:

![1.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/5.1.%20Connect%20the%20DAO%20to%20the%20Frontend/gif_2.webp?raw=true)

### Replace tree.json file

**(Please don't miss this step)** See your local folder, you will find `tree.json` there. For me, I found it in my Downloads folder.

![Frame 3560364 (32).jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/5.1.%20Connect%20the%20DAO%20to%20the%20Frontend/Frame_3560364_(32).webp)

Open your frontend code in your IDE or Visual Studio. Go to `src/artifacts/tree.json`. Replace the content of `tree.json` with the one that was downloaded in your local folder.

### Add token to your wallet

Now, follow the steps given below to add the token to your wallet:

1. Go to the "Dashboard".
2. Click on the "Parameters" button.
3. Copy the address of AirDropV2 under the value tab.
4. Now head back to Dashboard.
5. Click on the three dots of Dao Token Supply.
6. Select the option "Add to wallet" and click on "Add Token".
7. Open Metamask and now you will be able to see your token under the "Tokens" tab. For me, I named it Meta
8. Click on your token. I clicked on Meta. You can see the "Send" option. Click on it.
9. Paste the AirDropV2 address that you copied and send the tokens to it.

Awesome! you are all set for the next step.

### Vote on the proposal

Next, simply vote on the proposal:

After voting, you will see a window like this:

![Frame 3560365 (28).jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/5.1.%20Connect%20the%20DAO%20to%20the%20Frontend/Frame_3560365_(28).webp)

### Execute the proposals

When the voting timer ends, you will see “Execute” button. Click on it to execute the proposal. **Make sure you execute the proposal within 1-2 min after the voting ends or else the execution period will end.**

![Frame 3560365 (20).gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/5.1.%20Connect%20the%20DAO%20to%20the%20Frontend/gif_4.webp?raw=true)

Once you execute the proposal, it will show when the campaign will start.

### Claim the token

When the campaign starts, the whitelisted addresses can connect their wallet and claim their DAO token. I added my wallet as whitelisted one, so the following gif shows how I claimed my token:

After claiming, you can see it too:

Phew!!! It was a lot but kudos in completing it, Hurray!

## That’s a wrap

In summary, we have connected our DAO to the frontend and interacted with the Airdrop module which we have added to our DAO. Wohoo! And we are done, yayy!!!
