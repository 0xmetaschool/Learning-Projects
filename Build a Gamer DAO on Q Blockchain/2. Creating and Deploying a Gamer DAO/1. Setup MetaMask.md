# Setup MetaMask

Welcome back!  So, you've dived deep into learning about Q blockchain! Great job! Well, roll up your sleeves, because in this section we will be building stuff! A DAO! Are you excited? But before that let’s set up the necessary environment required to run your code. Let's get started!

## What is a development environment?

Firstly, we will be setting up an environment to run our code!

In this tutorial, you will use Metamask wallet, Q faucet, and Remix for compiling and deploying your code. Don’t worry, setting them is super easy and you will do it in no time!

### Setup

1. If you have not yet installed Metamask, you can download it from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) for Chrome. If you are using any other browser, kindly try searching MetaMask extension for your browser.

2. Open your MetaMask browser extension, scroll through networks and click on “Add Network” button.

    The following screen will appear after clicking the “Add Network” button.

3. Now click on the “Add a network manually” to add a new network to your MetaMask. 

4. Now fill in the following details:
    1. **Network name**: Q Testnet
    2. **New RPC URL**: [https://rpc.qtestnet.org/](https://rpc.qtestnet.org/)
    3. **Chain ID**: `35443`
    4. **Currency symbol**: Q
    5. **Block explorer URL**: [https://explorer.qtestnet.org/](https://explorer.qtestnet.org/)

5. Click on the “Save” button. Finally, click on “Q Testnet” button and switch to your newly added network.

## Fill your account with Q tokens

Next, we will fill your newly created Q Testnet account with tokens using the Q faucet. Here’s how you can do that:

### Steps

1. Copy your Q account address. you can find it in your MetaMask account.
2. Next, head over to [https://faucet.qtestnet.org/](https://faucet.qtestnet.org/), connect your MetaMask or paste your copied address to the Wallet address field. Select “I am human," and then click on “Claim tokens” button.

3. In the next couple of seconds, your wallet will be filled with 5 Q tokens.

Now you have Q tokens in your Metamask wallet. The next step is becoming familiar with the Remix IDE.

## What is Remix?

Remix is like an all-in-one toolbox for developers, and it is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Remix is a development environment that comes with all the tools that you would need to create a contract and deploy on blockchain. It is beginner friendly and very easy to understand to start with. 

Head over to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and click on “New File” button. Set the name of your file as `MyFirstDAO.sol`.

## That’s a wrap

Well, that’s it. We are all set to build our DAO.

In the next lesson, you will write code for DAO in the Solidity programming language which you will deploy on your Q network using Remix IDE later on.
