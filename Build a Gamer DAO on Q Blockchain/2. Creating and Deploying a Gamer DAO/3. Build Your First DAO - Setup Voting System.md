# Build Your First DAO - Setup Voting System

Alright, it's time to get back to work on our project's DAO! In this lesson, we're going to dive right back into building and making it even better. Get ready to take our project to the next level!

## Let’s continue coding

Let’s continue adding functionalities to our DAO. 

### Create proposal

```
function createProposal(string memory _description) public {
		    proposals.push(Proposal({
		        description: _description,
		        voteCount: 0,
                yesVotes: 0,
                noVotes: 0,
		        executed: false
		    }));
		    emit ProposalCreated(proposals.length - 1, _description);
}
```

- `createProposal` function is used to create a new proposal within the DAO.
- It takes a string `_description` as an argument and creates a new Proposal struct with the provided description, an initial vote count of 0, and `executed` status set to false. We will further see that the there will be update in total number of votes as members vote and the `executed` will be true once the proposal is executed.
- This new proposal is added to the `proposals` array, and the `ProposalCreated` event is emitted.

### Vote

```
function voteYes(uint _proposalId, uint _tokenAmount) public {
    require(isMember[msg.sender] == true, "You should be a memeber to vote");
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _tokenAmount, "Not enough tokens to vote");
    require(votes[msg.sender][_proposalId] == false, "You have already voted for this proposal");
    votes[msg.sender][_proposalId] = true;
    memberInfo[msg.sender].tokenBalance -= _tokenAmount;
    proposals[_proposalId].voteCount += _tokenAmount;
    proposals[_proposalId].yesVotes += _tokenAmount;
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, _proposalId, _tokenAmount);
}
```

- `voteYes` function allows a member to vote Yes on a proposal which indicates that the member wants the proposal to be executed.
- It takes two arguments:
    - `_proposalId`: The ID of the proposal being voted on.
    - `_tokenAmount`: The number of tokens the member wants to vote with.
- The function performs several checks before processing the vote:
    - It checks if the sender (the person calling the function) is a member of the DAO. If the sender's account address doesn't exist in the `memberInfo` mapping, it means they are not a member, and the function throws an error with the message "Only members can vote."
    - It verifies that the sender has enough tokens in their balance to cover the `_tokenAmount` they want to use for voting. If their token balance is lower than the desired amount, the function throws an error with the message "Not enough tokens to vote."
    - It checks if the sender has already voted for the specified proposal. If the sender's vote for the proposal is already recorded as `true` in the `votes` mapping, it means they have already voted, and the function throws an error with the message "You have already voted for this proposal."
- If all the checks pass, the function updates the necessary data:
    - It sets the sender's vote for the specified proposal to `true` in the `votes` mapping, indicating that they have voted.
    - It deducts the `_tokenAmount` from the sender's token balance by reducing their `tokenBalance` in the `memberInfo` mapping.
    - It increases the vote count of the specified proposal by adding the `_tokenAmount` to the existing `voteCount` in the corresponding `proposals` array element.
    - It also increases the number of `yesVotes` obtained on this proposal.
- Finally, the function emits the `VoteCast` event to notify the participants that a vote has been cast. The event includes the sender's address, the ID of the proposal they voted on, and the amount of tokens they used for voting.

```
function voteNo(uint _proposalId, uint _tokenAmount) public {
    require(isMember[msg.sender] == true, "You should be a memeber to vote");
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _tokenAmount, "Not enough tokens to vote");
    require(votes[msg.sender][_proposalId] == false, "You have already voted for this proposal");
    votes[msg.sender][_proposalId] = true;
    memberInfo[msg.sender].tokenBalance -= _tokenAmount;
    proposals[_proposalId].voteCount += _tokenAmount;
    proposals[_proposalId].noVotes += _tokenAmount;
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, _proposalId, _tokenAmount);
}
```

`voteNo` function also does exact same things are voteYes but here it increases the count of `noVotes`

### Execute proposal

```
function executeProposal(uint _proposalId) public {
    require(proposals[_proposalId].executed == false, "Proposal has already been executed");
      require(proposals[_proposalId].yesVotes > proposals[_proposalId].noVotes);
      proposals[_proposalId].executed = true;
      emit ProposalAccepted("Proposal has been approved");
}
```

- `executeProposal` function is responsible for executing a proposal in the DAO. It takes a parameter `_proposalId` representing the ID of the proposal to be executed.
- It first checks if the proposal has already been executed.
    - If the `executed` flag of the specified proposal is set to `true`, it means the proposal has already been executed, and the function throws an error using the `require` statement.
- If the proposal hasn't been executed, the function proceeds to check if the vote count for the proposal is greater has higher ‘Yes’ votes than ‘No’ votes.

```
proposals[_proposalId].yesVotes > proposals[_proposalId].noVotes
```

- If the proposal has received a majority yes vote, the `executed` flag of the proposal is set to `true`, indicating that the proposal has been approved and executed.
    - The function emits the `ProposalAccepted` event with the message "Proposal has been approved".
- If the proposal does not receive a majority vote, the `ProposalRejected` event is emitted with the message "Proposal has not been approved by majority vote".

## That’s a wrap

Let’s look at what we did here. We wrote a complete `DAO` contract in Solidity. So let’s look at the complete code.

You did great! You have learnt the basics of writing an `DAO` contract in Solidity programming language.

In the next lesson, we'll compile and deploy this `DAO` contract and see what we get!
