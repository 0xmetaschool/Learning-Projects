# Deploy the Dex DApp

Great work on setting up your development environment for Move on Sui. In this lesson, we will learn to run and deploy a `dex` Move project on the Sui blockchain and explore it in the Explorer.

## Update `Move.toml` file

To successfully deploy your Dex Sui project, it is necessary to update the `Move.toml` file. This update is required to ensure that certain dependencies can be easily installed and used. During the implementation of the contracts, you may have noticed the use of some libraries. To install and use these libraries, please update the `Move.toml` file with the following information.

**Note:** Remember to use same package name as you used while creating the Move on Sui project.

```
[package]
name = "dex"
version = "0.0.1"

[dependencies]
MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/move-stdlib", rev = "testnet-v1.14.0" }
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet-v1.14.0" }
DeepBook = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/deepbook", rev = "testnet-v1.14.0" }

[addresses]
dex = "0x0"
std = "0x1"
sui = "0x2"
deepbook = "0xdee9"
```

## Build and publish on Sui

Now let’s build our Move file using the following command. Remember to move to the `dex` folder using `cd dex` command.

```
sui move build
```

This will generate an output like the following:

**Note**: Ignore all the warnings and move forward.

After running the command, your project directory will include a `build` folder and a `Move.lock` file.

![deploy-2.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/ba2ce8dea0997931621928704f03f1a8483ecc0d/Build%20the%20Token%20Dex%20DApp/4.%20Deploy%20the%20DApp/assets/deploy-2.png?raw=true)

### Set up the development environment

To deploy on Sui Testnet, please execute the following commands.

```
sui client new-env --alias=testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env testnet
```

### Publish the contract

Run the following command to publish the Move project to the testnet finally:

```
sui client publish --skip-dependency-verification --gas-budget 90000000
```
Note: When you are deploying on production, we recommend not to use the `--skip-dependency-verification` flag

We will have a long output but scroll to the start of the output and copy the Transaction Digest:

![deploy-3.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/ba2ce8dea0997931621928704f03f1a8483ecc0d/Build%20the%20Token%20Dex%20DApp/4.%20Deploy%20the%20DApp/assets/deploy-3.png?raw=true)

- **Note**: Ignore all the warnings and move forward. But if you encounter an “Insufficient funds” error then you can head over to the [Sui Testnet faucet discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) and paste “!faucet [YOUR_ADDRESS]” to receive 10 SUI tokens.
    
    

Head over to [https://suiexplorer.com/?network=testnet](https://suiexplorer.com/?network=testnet). Paste the Transaction Digest in the search bar to find your transaction on the Sui Explorer:

![deploy-4.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/ba2ce8dea0997931621928704f03f1a8483ecc0d/Build%20the%20Token%20Dex%20DApp/4.%20Deploy%20the%20DApp/assets/deploy-4.png?raw=true)

Whoo! You did great but wait! Now you need to create the pool. A pool is something that will fill your dex app with tokens. To do this, we need to run the following functions present in `sources/dex.move` file.

1. `create_pool`
2. `create_state`
3. `fill_pool`

Here’s the screenshot of these functions from the `sources/dex.move` file.

![pool-code.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/ba2ce8dea0997931621928704f03f1a8483ecc0d/Build%20the%20Token%20Dex%20DApp/4.%20Deploy%20the%20DApp/assets/pool-code.png?raw=true)

To run these functions we need 100 SUI tokens in our testnet wallet address. It is almost impossible to get 100 SUI tokens for free even for the testnet account.

So, to solve this problem we have already created a pool for you on the following address. Here is the Package ID of our DEX contract

Note: If you are looking to build a end to end product on Sui, please reach out to the Metaschool team and we will help you with the 100 Sui tokens.

```

And the following is the DEX Storage ID, which we will use in the next lesson.

```
0x6912d83e2c4868386511fe3f6f18aff9399b9ad5cae2d97943766e2ff160ab25
```

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, this lesson introduced running smart contracts on Sui. We learned how to create a Move workspace, build and publish Move files, create a Sui account, and deploy a contract on the Sui testnet. Congratulations on completing this lesson!
