# Interact With the Frontend

You have successfully set up everything for your front end, but there is one final step remaining. In this lesson, we will configure the ZK login credentials, run the front end, explore its features, and learn how to interact with Sui Move contracts through the front end.

## Set up ZK Login

Please navigate to the `.env` file in your frontend directory and add the following line. We have already configured ZK Login for your convenience, so you can simply copy and paste the ZK Prover URL without having to spend hours on its setup.

```
URL_ZK_PROVER=http://175.41.177.22:8001/v1
```

If you want to set up ZK Login on your own, please follow the instructions given in the [Readme.md](http://Readme.md) file provided in this link.

## Interact with the frontend

Let's run our app by entering the following command in your terminal, located in the frontend directory, now that all credentials have been set up.

```
yarn dev
```

This time try again to log in by clicking on the “Sign with Google” button. Verify you Google account and then log in. After logging in wait for a few seconds for ZK to get connected with your app. After the request is completed, you will see a page like this.

Let’s play around with different features of our application and see how it works.

1. First, click on the “Mint SUI” button to increase your SUI balance.
2. To fill your USDC and ETH balance, click on the “Mint ETH” and “Mint USDC” buttons separately.
3. Before swapping, it is necessary to increase balances because, without any ETH or USDC, you will not be able to swap the tokens.
4. To swap the tokens, fill in the balance and click on the “Swap” button.
5. If you want to swap ETH to USDC or USDC to ETH, click on the arrow button to switch their places.

## That’s a wrap

We’re so proud of you for completing the course and setting up your own Dex application. In the next lesson, we will wrap up the course and overview what you have learned so far.
