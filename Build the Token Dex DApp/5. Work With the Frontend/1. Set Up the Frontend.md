# Set Up the Frontend

Kudos! We have deployed our dApp. We are all set to proceed in setting up our frontend. No more waiting, let’s go!

## Setting up the Dex frontend

Open a new terminal in your `dex` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to clone the frontend directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/sui-dex-frontend
```

The front end will have the following file structure.

Let’s install our dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Find the dex package ID

Next, we need to find the package ID of our `dex` module, that we implemented while writing the contracts. Follow the following steps to do so.

1. Head over to the Sui Explorer and enter the Transaction Digest that you got in the last lesson in the search bar.

1. You can see the sidebar with the “Summary” heading. Please scroll to the end of the sidebar to find the “Publish” field.

1. Now, open the “Object” field by clicking on the “>” sign in the “Publish” field and click on the “dex” module.

You will see the page something like this:

1. Copy your package ID, as mentioned in the following screenshot. This will be your dex package ID that we will use in our front end.
    
    ![frontend-5.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend%20150b39740ae4440dae71b58721f2506d/frontend-5.png)
    
    ## Set Up environment variables
    
    Why do we even need a dex package ID? We need the ID to connect our Move project with the front end. Remember we discussed in the last lesson that to run the dex app we need a pool. So, head over to the `.env` file in your cloned frontend, and use the following package ID as this package ID has already filled the pool with 100 SUI for your ease.
    
    ```
    DEX_PACKAGE_ID=0xa1dce324bcf781692a358adb27bd105844231d35863b5c99f94e54801d653788
    ```
    
    Also, if the .env file is not updated remember to paste the following `DEX_STORAGE_ID` as well.
    
    ```
    DEX_STORAGE_ID=0x6912d83e2c4868386511fe3f6f18aff9399b9ad5cae2d97943766e2ff160ab25
    ```
    
    If you have created your pool then you can use your IDs. We need to fill the pool because without filling the pool the app will give you errors.
    
    ## Run the frontend
    
    To run the frontend, run the following command in your terminal.
    
    ```
    yarn dev
    ```
    
    The command will give you an output like this:
    
    ![frontend-6.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend%20150b39740ae4440dae71b58721f2506d/frontend-6.png)
    
    Head over to the link, the `local` field is showing to you. You will see something like this in your browser.
    
    ![frontend-7.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend%20150b39740ae4440dae71b58721f2506d/frontend-7.png)
    
    Here, you can see there is an option to sign in using Google. When you try to click on the “Sign with Google” button it will give the following response.
    
    ![frontend-8.png](Set%20Up%20the%20Frontend%20150b39740ae4440dae71b58721f2506d/frontend-8.png)
    
     So, we need Google Cloud credentials that will allow us to sign in using Google and use our application.
    
    ## That’s a wrap
    
    Phew, we’re so proud of you for setting up the front end all by yourself. Next, we will set up the Google Cloud credentials and get our front end up and running.
