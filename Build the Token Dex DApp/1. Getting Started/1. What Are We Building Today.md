# What Are We Building Today

Gm everyone ☀️, today we are very excited to bring the fourth course of our detailed series about Sui blockchain for developers on Metaschool. Let’s start the fourth course by congratulating you for completing the first three courses on Sui. Woohoo!

So, what are we building today? We will be building a Token Swap Defi application using Move on Sui, which will help users implement the swap feature in a dex. This dApp will help you swap the Ethereum tokens with the USDC tokens. This project will help you learn to build the end-to-end defi application using Move on Sui.

Let’s look at what your Dex dApp will look like.
