# Set Up Environment

Welcome back! In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up the environment and the Move project for running your code.

**Note:** We assume that you have already installed the Sui and Rust in your system in the first course of the Sui course path. If not, you can go to this [link](https://metaschool.so/courses/build-on-move-on-sui-and-explore-its-applications/lesson/aa506de1-411f-4675-b9bb-36c746ee31ee) and install it. 

## Check your version

Open your favorite terminal. Let’s check your Sui installation version.

```
sui --version
```

**Note:** If you face errors while installing Sui please make sure to follow all the steps in the lesson [Deploy Your First Sui Contract.](https://metaschool.so/courses/build-on-move-on-sui-and-explore-its-applications/lesson/1f15e1bb-7023-4487-ab7d-21233318af91)

## Set up the Move project

Open your favorite terminal because we will be running a few commands to achieve our goal.

The first step is to initialize a workspace environment. This will contain the basic files for running any Move file. You can create the workspace using the following command; I have named mine as `dex`:

```
sui move new dex
```

The command will generate a folder named `dex` and it will contain a file `Move.toml` and a folder `sources`.

- P.S.: I am using Visual Studio IDE as it visualizes the structure of my workspace better.

Time to create files for coding, so follow the steps given below:

- Now create 3 new files in the `sources` folder named:
    - `eth.move`
    - `usdc.move`
    - `dex.move`
    
    We will be writing our code in these files.
    
- Next, create a `test` folder in `sources` and create a file named `test_dex.move` inside it.

This is how your project structure will look like:

## Check your wallet

You can view the current active address using the following command:

```
sui client active-address
```

If you do not have an active address, follow the steps given below:

1. Run the following command to create your Sui account:
    
    ```
    sui client new-address ed25519
    ```
    
    It will generate the output something like this:

- **Important**: Save the recovery phrase, it is important to have it to import your wallet.
1. Replace `[YOUR_ADDRESS]` in the command below with the address you received after running the last command and run it.
    
    ```
    sui client switch --address [YOUR_ADDRESS]
    ```
    
2. Head over to the [Sui Testnet faucet discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) and paste “!faucet [YOUR_ADDRESS]” to receive 10 SUI tokens.

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned how to set up our project for writing code in Move on Sui. By following the provided steps, we are now ready to start writing code for our Move project. Happy coding!
