# Lesson 3: Writing Smart Contract Basics

In this lesson, we will explore the architecture of a Solidity smart contract designed for a social media platform like what structs or mapping we need. But this time, we wonâ€™t make it easy for you. We do have a few assignments for you to solve to test your knowledge. So letâ€™s dive into it right away~

## Setting Up Your Project

We will first make sure that we are at the right branch. Run the following command to be at the `boilerplate01` branch. At `boilerplate01`, we have made a basic HardHat project for you with the empty files. Youâ€™ll have to implement the code in those files.

```
git checkout boilerplate01
cd build-social-media-dapp-on-core
```

Navigate to `contracts/Metacircle.sol` and we have implemented basics there with a few missing pieces of code left for you to fill out. Letâ€™s go through them one by one.

## Contract Declaration and Structs

First, we have contract and structs declarations. We defined three stucts: `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`. Do we need any other struct?

## User Struct

We have our first struct named `User` and it has the following variables in it:

- **userAddress:** The user's Core chain address.
- **username:** The display name chosen by the user.
- **bio:** A short biography or description of the user.

And our first assignment! Replace `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE` in Line `9` with the ***data type*** of `userAddress`. And the hint is that the data type is part of the variable name ðŸ˜›

## Post Struct

We have our next struct named `Post` and it has the following variables in it:

- **postId:** A unique identifier for each post.
- **author:** The address of the user who created the post.
- **content:** The content of the post.
- **likes:** The count of likes the post has received.
- **likedBy:** A mapping to track which users have liked the post.

Time for assignment #2! Replace `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE` in Line `20` with the ***data type*** of `likes`. 

**Hint:** Itâ€™s a count so what data type is the best to store it?

## Comment Struct

The last struct is named `Comment` and it has the following variables in it:

- **commentId:** A unique identifier for each comment.
- **authorUsername:** The address of the user who wrote the comment.
- **postId:** The ID of the post the comment is associated with.
- **content:** The content of the comment.

Time for assignment #3! Replace `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE` in Line `31` with the ***data type*** of `content`. 

**Hint:** This variable will contain the sentences or paragraphs entered by the user, so what data type is the best to store such info?

![core c5 (4).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/core-c5-build-decentralized-sm-dapp/3.%20Writing%20Smart%20Contract%20Basics/core_c5_(4).jpg?raw=true)

## Mappings for Storage

Mappings are used to store data in key-value pairs. Here, mappings store users, posts, and comments:

- **users:** Maps an address to a `User` struct.
- **posts:** Maps a post ID to a `Post` struct.
- **comments:** Maps a comment ID to a `Comment` struct.

**Assignment**: Replace `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE` in Line `37` with the correct Struct.

![core c5 (5).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/core-c5-build-decentralized-sm-dapp/3.%20Writing%20Smart%20Contract%20Basics/core_c5_(5).jpg?raw=true)

## Counters for Unique IDs

Counters are used to ensure that each post and comment has a unique ID.

- **postCount:** Tracks the number of posts created.
- **commentCount:** Tracks the number of comments created.

**Assignment**: Replace `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE` in Line `43` with the modifier.

I know youâ€™ll get it right! Fill it out!!

## Push your code

Implement the complete code of the `Metacircle.sol` contract and push it to the `boilerplate01` branch. You can run the following commands.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Done with the implementation of basics in social media dApp"
git push -u origin boilerplate01
```

## Wrap Up

In this lesson, we've explored the basics of our contract and implemented them. We've defined data structures using structs, stored data with mappings, and used counters to manage unique IDs. While this contract forms the foundation, additional functionality and security measures would be needed for a fully operational social media platform on the blockchain. And we will explore that in the upcoming lesson, so stay tuned!
