# zkVerify's Proof Verification Architecture

Welcome back! In our previous lessons, we laid the foundation for understanding zkVerify, the groundbreaking modular blockchain that leverages zero-knowledge proofs. Now, it's time to take a closer look at the heart of zkVerify – its proof verification architecture. In this lesson, we'll uncover the step-by-step process of how proofs are submitted and verified. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how zkVerify ensures the integrity and security of data while maintaining its commitment to decentralization. So, let's dive into the inner workings of this innovative technology!

zkVerify is made up of 5 core components. Let’s go through each of them one by one.

## Proof submitters: The driving force behind zkVerify

Proof submitters are the lifeblood of the zkVerify ecosystem. They are the individuals, developers, or organizations who utilize zkVerify to verify their zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). But why would someone choose zkVerify for this purpose?

zkVerify supports a wide range of proving systems and proof types, opening the door to innovative applications that might not be feasible on other blockchains. This flexibility empowers developers to explore cutting-edge cryptographic techniques and build novel solutions without being limited by the constraints of a single blockchain ecosystem.

## Proof submission interface: Your gateway to proof verification

Imagine you've developed a zkRollup or a zkApp that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs Now, you need to verify the validity of your proofs on the zkVerify network. This is where the Proof Submission Interface comes in.

### Technically speaking

The Proof Submission Interface consists of transactions and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods that enable you to submit your proof to the zkVerify network. It provides a standardized format for proof submission, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.

### How it works

1. **Proof generation:** You generate your zero-knowledge proof for your zkRollup or zkApp. This proof encapsulates the validity of your data or computation.
2. **Proof Submission:** You use the Proof Submission Interface to securely transmit your proof to the zkVerify network. This involves creating a transaction that includes your proof data.
3. **Mainchain verification:** The zkVerify Mainchain, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, receives your proof. The Mainchain utilizes its specialized verifier modules (fflonk, zksync-era, risc0, and Groth16) to assess the validity of your proof.
4. **Verification results:**
    - **Valid proof:** If the proof is valid, it is included in a Mainchain block. This marks the proof as officially verified and accepted by the zkVerify network.
    - **Invalid proof:** If the proof is invalid, the transaction reverts with an error. However, the failing transaction will still be included in the block to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This means that even if your proof is rejected, you will still incur fees for the transaction.

## Mainchain: The zkVerify powerhouse

The Mainchain, a Layer 1 Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) blockchain built on the Substrate framework, serves as the core infrastructure for zkVerify. A decentralized network of validators upholds the integrity of the blockchain through a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This means that instead of miners, validators stake their tokens to participate in the validation process, ensuring the network's security and accuracy.

Within the zkVerify ecosystem, the Mainchain plays several crucial roles:

1. **The verifier:** The Mainchain houses powerful verification modules, including the Fflonk native verifier for general-purpose ZKPs, the Groth16 verifier for Ethereum-compatible proofs, the RISC Zero verifier for a broader range of zk-applications, and the zkSync Era verifier, specifically tailored for the zkSync Era Layer 2 scaling solution. This multi-verifier approach empowers zkVerify to handle diverse types of ZKPs, catering to a wide array of use cases within the Web3 ecosystem. More verifiers will be added over time to further expand zkVerify's capabilities and support a wider range of zero-knowledge proof systems.
2. **The recorder:** This step focuses on the internal record-keeping of the zkVerify Mainchain. Once a proof is verified by the verifier, it's etched into the blockchain itself to ensure that the proof's validity is permanently recorded.

In summary, the Mainchain is the backbone of zkVerify, providing a secure and efficient platform for proof verification, storage, and value exchange. Its robust architecture and advanced verification capabilities make it a key component in unlocking the potential of ZKPs for real-world applications.

## Attestation: Your proof's seal of approval

![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-zkverify-horizen/Lesson%205_%20zkVerify's%20Proof%20Verification%20Architecture/image5.webp?raw=true)

In zkVerify, attestation is the process of creating a publicly verifiable record of your proof's validity on other blockchains (in addition to zkVerify mainchain). For example, imagine that after your university meticulously verifies your academic transcript, you need to have it attested by a higher educational authority to confirm its authenticity for further studies.

Why is this necessary? Submitting each individual proof to a blockchain like Ethereum would be extremely expensive due to the high gas fees associated with each transaction. It would be like sending every single page of your transcript separately, incurring exorbitant postage costs.

### The Solution: Merkle Trees and Roots

zkVerify cleverly solves this problem using Merkle Trees, a type of data structure that acts as a digital fingerprint for a set of data. Instead of submitting every single proof, zkVerify organizes them into a Merkle Tree.

![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-zkverify-horizen/Lesson%205_%20zkVerify's%20Proof%20Verification%20Architecture/image1.webp?raw=true)

This tree has branches that combine the hashes (unique identifiers) of multiple proofs. At the very top of the tree is the Merkle Root – a single hash that represents all the proofs in the tree.

### Efficient attestation

Instead of submitting each proof, zkVerify publishes only the Merkle Root onto a smart contract on chains like Gobi, Jenkins, and Sepolia. This is like sending a single letter (the Merkle Root) that contains a summary of your entire academic record.

To prove that a proof is a part of the attestation, the user can supply a Merkle proof leading from its path from the Merkle’s root to the zkVerify Smart Contract deployed on the chains where these attestations are stored

In summary, attestation is a crucial step in the zkVerify process. It ensures the integrity and validity of proofs by creating a publicly verifiable record on the blockchain. By utilizing Merkle Trees and Roots, zkVerify achieves this attestation efficiently and cost-effectively, enabling the scalability and accessibility of zero-knowledge proof verification even outside of the zkVerify ecosystem.

## zkVerify smart contract: The keeper of attestations and proof validation

![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-zkverify-horizen/Lesson%205_%20zkVerify's%20Proof%20Verification%20Architecture/image6.webp?raw=true)

After your proof has been verified by the Mainchain it is attested on the destination blockchain (= stored in the zkVerify smart contract on that chain). Think of it as the official record keeper, responsible for maintaining the integrity and accessibility of your verified proofs.

This smart contract, residing on the blockchain, acts as a secure and transparent repository for attestations. Each attestation represents a batch of verified proofs, bundled together and summarized using a Merkle Root. The smart contract meticulously stores these Merkle Roots, creating a public record of all verified proofs and also provides you with the means to check if your specific proof was included in a particular attestation. This is like checking a library's catalog to see if a specific book is part of its collection, together with the indication to the specific shelf.

The zkVerify Smart Contract plays a pivotal role in building trust and transparency within the zkVerify ecosystem. By providing a publicly accessible and verifiable record of attestations, it ensures that anyone can check the validity of proofs without needing to trust any single entity. This is a crucial step towards enabling the widespread adoption of zero-knowledge proofs in various applications, as it guarantees the integrity and security of the underlying data.
