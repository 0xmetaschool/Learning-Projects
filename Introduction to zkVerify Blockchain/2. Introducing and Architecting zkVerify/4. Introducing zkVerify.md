# Introducing zkVerify

Hey there! You're now masters of zero-knowledge proofs and ZK Rollups, and you totally get how they work. Awesome, right? But why did we even learn about them and spend so much of our time understanding their basic mechanics?

It’s because Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of zkVerify's technology and they play a pivotal role in its ability to improve and enhance ZK Rollups. zkVerify leverages the power of ZKPs to provide secure and efficient verification for a wide range of blockchain projects and decentralized applications (dApps). But what exactly is zkVerify? Let’s explore it in detail.

## What is zkVerify?

Picture this: you’re throwing the biggest, coolest outdoor music festival ever! To make sure everything goes off without a hitch, you decide to split the event into different parts, each with its own team in charge.

1. **Execution (Stage Performance Team)**: These folks handle all the performances. They get the artists ready, ensure the sound is perfect, and make sure the show rocks on without any hiccups.
2. **Consensus (Crowd Control Team)**: This team keeps the crowd happy and safe. They make sure everyone follows the rules and has a blast without any trouble.
3. **Data Availability (Media Team)**: This crew captures and shares every awesome moment of the festival. They take photos, record videos, and update social media so everyone can see what’s happening in real time.

Just like your music festival, web3 developers love breaking down blockchain functions into separate modules to make them work better and more efficiently. Each module has a specific job, helping the whole system run smoother.

Inspired by modular systems, Horizen Labs introduced **zkVerify**—the ultimate proof verification layer for blockchains!

Imagine zkVerify as your go-to network that helps blockchains handle heavy and expensive proof verifications. It's the first modular solution that can reduce the cost of proof verification on Ethereum and other blockchains by an impressive 90%+!

What does this mean? zkVerify takes zero-knowledge proofs to the next level by making proof verifications cheaper and faster for all kinds of projects and apps. Its main goal is to boost the efficiency of ZKP verification.

zkVerify is a high-performance, public, decentralized, reliable, and secure blockchain. It offers modular solutions and more affordable proof verification, with verifiers written in the Rust programming language. Just like breaking down a big task into smaller, manageable parts, zkVerify makes blockchain processes smoother and more efficient!

Let’s understand the goals of zkVerify by taking a real-world example and how zkVerify deals with it.

## Let’s discuss the “Motivations behind zkVerify”

Let's imagine you're organizing an epic amusement park day for a huge group of friends. You want everyone to have a blast, but there are some big challenges to overcome. Here's how the motivations behind zkVerify fit into this fun example:

## Prohibitive costs

### The Problem
Amusement parks can be super expensive! You have to pay for tickets, food, rides, and games. Imagine if the costs change based on the number of people in line for each ride, just like the fluctuating gas fees on the Ethereum network during peak times. One minute a roller coaster ride is $5; the next it's $50! This unpredictability makes it hard for everyone to enjoy the day without worrying about their budget, similar to how high gas fees can deter users from transacting on Ethereum.

### zkVerify's Solution
zkVerify is like having a pass that drastically cuts down these unpredictable costs. Normally, verifying a zero-knowledge proof on Ethereum can be expensive due to high gas fees, especially during network congestion. These fees range from $20 to $60 per single proof verification! Using zkVerify is like having a special ticket that keeps costs low and stable, no matter how crowded the park gets. This way, everyone can enjoy more rides without breaking the bank.

## Hampering innovation

### The Problem
Imagine the amusement park has tons of awesome new rides planned, but they can't open them because they need specialized components that are difficult and costly to acquire. This is similar to the Ethereum blockchain, where certain advanced cryptographic techniques can't be used easily because they are too expensive or not supported.

### zkVerify's Solution
zkVerify is like a super-efficient supplier that provides all the parts the amusement park needs at a lower cost and with more variety. Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) help introduce new features, like new rides, but the process is slow and requires a lot of agreement from different stakeholders. zkVerify makes it easier to adopt new cryptographic standards and techniques without waiting for a lengthy approval process. This way, the amusement park (or blockchain) can keep innovating and adding exciting new features for everyone to enjoy.

## The “Goals of zkVerify”

1. **Reducing Costs**: Just like keeping amusement park tickets affordable, zkVerify helps keep blockchain-proof verification costs low and stable. This also enhances the efficiency by offloading the computational burden of the blockchain while reducing the cost.
2. **Promoting Innovation**: Just like adding new, thrilling rides to the park, zkVerify supports the use of new cryptographic methods, making the blockchain more versatile, modular, and innovative.
3. **Ensuring Smooth Experience**: By handling heavy verification processes, zkVerify ensures the blockchain runs smoothly, much like ensuring all the park's rides are up and running without long wait times.

## That’s a wrap

zkVerify is a great innovation that introduces a modular proof verification layer of ZK proofs. zkVerify reduces proof verification costs by +90% and offers a more efficient blockchain system.

As we now know the goals of zkVerify in detail, we need to understand the exact problems it solves. Let’s discuss all of this in the next lesson. Stay tuned!
