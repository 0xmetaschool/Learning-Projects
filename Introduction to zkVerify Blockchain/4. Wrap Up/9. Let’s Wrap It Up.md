# Let‚Äôs Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! üéâ It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. We covered a lot of the technical components of proof verification and zkVerify - here‚Äôs a quick overview of our lessons.

## What we covered

We covered the following in our first zkVerify course:

1. We got an understanding of ZK proofs along with a basic overview of zkSNARKs & zkSTARKs.
2. We got to know the scalability challenge faced by the blockchains and how ZK Rollups solved this problem.
3. We also learnt about the high proof verification costs faced by ZK Rollups.
4. We got an understanding of zkVerify and how it reduces proof verification costs by 90%.
5. We got an understanding of the goals and motivations behind the zkVerify.
6. We went through a deeper dive into how zkVerify proof verification works and its technical architecture.
7. And lastly, we set up the wallet and got some testnet tokens to use on the zkVerify testnet.
