# Setting Up a Wallet and Connecting to Testnet

Congratulations on coming this far in the course!

In this lesson, we will be going through the process of setting up a wallet and getting some zkVerift ACME testnet tokens. We hope you are super excited about that! So without any delay, let’s get right into it.

## Setting Up a Wallet

There are currently two recommended wallet options -  Talisman and SubWallet. We will be going ahead and setting up a wallet with Talisman. Talisman provides a secure and user-friendly platform for managing assets, interacting with dApps, and exploring both the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems. It also comes with support for a variety of networks, NFT management, and hardware wallets, Talisman presents itself as a holistic wallet solution.

Follow the instructions below to set up your Talisman wallet:

- Click on [https://www.talisman.xyz/](https://www.talisman.xyz/) and click on the “Download Wallet” button.

- Next, click on the “Add to Chrome button” to add the wallet extension to your Chrome. Please make sure you are using Chrome for this tutorial.

- Now after adding the wallet, it will prompt you to the new window. Click on the “Get Started” button to continue.

- You will be asked to choose a strong password now. Please set a strong password and click on the “Continue” button. If prompted to agree to privacy policies please click on the “I Agree” button.

- Once you’re done, click on the “New Polkadot Account” button to create a new account.

- You will be asked to give a name to your account. So, give any name to your account. We gave it zkVerify and click on the “Create” button.

- You will be prompted to save your seed phrase. Make sure you save your seed phrase properly as it's very crucial. Verify your seed phrase next and complete the verification.

Once that is done, congratulations!!! You have successfully set up your wallet!!

## Explore the zkVerify Testnet blockchain

Now, let’s add Test Network and get some testnet $ACME tokens as well.

1. Click on the three dots in the lower right corner of the Talisman wallet. Then click on the “Settings” button as pointed out in the following image.

5. Click on the “Add Network” button as shown in the screenshot.
    
    ![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-zkverify-horizen/Lesson%206_%20Setting%20Up%20a%20Wallet%20and%20Connecting%20to%20Testnet/image11.png?raw=true)
    
6. Fill in the information with the following and click on the “Add Network” button:
    - RPC URLs: wss://testnet-rpc.zkverify.io
    - Network Name: zkVerify Testnet

    ![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets-for-zkverify-horizen/Lesson%206_%20Setting%20Up%20a%20Wallet%20and%20Connecting%20to%20Testnet/image13.png?raw=true)

Now, once you have added a network when you search for networks, you should see your Network in the option.

## Copy wallet address

Now, you need to find and copy the wallet address to get some testnet tokens. So, follow the following steps:

1. Go back to your Talisman wallet.
2. You must be able to see the account name you added to your account. Click on it.
3. Then click on the copy button.
4. Next, you will be prompted to select the network. Type “zkVerify” in the search bar. There you’ll find the “zkVerify Network”. Click on the copy button to finally copy the wallet address.

## Get $ACME zkVerify Testnet Tokens

To get testnet $ACME token:

- Go to [Test Token Faucet Request form](https://cztdlssdwco.typeform.com/to/GD6xdx2I?typeform-source=www.google.com),
- Enter your email address and wallet address you copied and should be able to receive $ACME within 24 hours.

## That’s a Wrap

Great job on completing this lesson. Next, we are going to do something really really fun. We will create proofs and verify them! And we are sure that you don’t want to miss it. So see you in the next section!
