# Sending the Proof to zkVerify For Verification

In the last lesson, we generated proof. Now it's time for the most fun part. Yes, we are now going to send the proofs we generated in the last lesson to zkVerify for verification.! Let’s get straight to it!

## Send the proof to zkVerify

1. Firstly, head over to this link - [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.zkverify.io#/extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.zkverify.io#/extrinsics)
2. Once you are there, you will be asked to connect to the wallet. After you are connected, you will see a screen like below. Then, select your account from the option provided.

3. Next, you need to choose `settlementGroth16Pallet` and `submitProof` which are like so:

5. Next, we will need to return to the JSON files we generated during the previous lesson. First, let’s go to the `verification_key_zkv.json` file and paste the fields from that file. Make sure that you do not include the quotes.

6. For `gammaAbcG1`, we need to add an item as we have two fields by pressing on ‘Add item’ and then adding both of them like below.

7. The next step is to go to the file `proof_zkv.json` and paste copy `a`, `b`, and `c` inputs from the file and paste them in the respective fields like so:

8. The last and final step is to go to `public_zkv.json` file and copy and paste in the last field. Now our final stage of submission before submitting the transaction looks like below:

## Submit the transactions

The final stage is to now submit the transaction.

1. Click on the ‘Submit transaction’ button and you will see a page where you can sign and submit the transaction.

2. You now need to ‘Approve’ the transaction with your Talisman wallet. After you approve the transaction, wait for a few seconds as your transaction is getting completed. Once your transaction is completed, you will get a notification from Talisman wallet.

3. Convert your address to the new format:
    a. Go to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/utilities](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/utilities)
    b. Paste your Talisman wallet address into the conversion tool.
    c. Copy the new converted address format.

1. Now that your transaction is complete and you have your converted address, paste the new address into the explorer - [https://testnet-explorer.zkverify.io/v0](https://testnet-explorer.zkverify.io/v0)
