# What Are We Learning Today

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, gm. We are very excited to bring the first-ever learning tutorial for developers on the zkVerify blockchain on the Metaschool platform. Exciting, right?

First, let's see some great numbers. At the time of writing, zkVerify has already hit a strong following on [X of 12K followers](https://x.com/ZKVProtocol) and [5k+ discord members](https://discord.com/invite/zkverify). Awesome, isnâ€™t it?

Great! But why zkVerify ðŸ¤”? Horizen Labs, a well-known name in the web3 world, introduced zkVerify to the public. Founded in 2019, Horizen Labs is dedicated to building secure blockchains and web3 products to solve real-world problems. Their mission is to scale decentralized networks by reducing the costs associated with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove something is true without revealing the details. These proofs are essential for ensuring privacy, security, and scalability in web3 applications like private transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. However, traditional ZKPs can make blockchain transactions expensive due to the high computational cost of verifying these proofs, hindering their widespread adoption.

Enter **zkVerify**, Horizen Labs' innovative solution designed to drastically reduce the cost of ZKP verification â€“ not by a mere 10-20%, but by a staggering **90%+**. zkVerify isn't just another blockchain; it's a blockchain purpose-built for ZKPs verification. This breakthrough technology opens the door to a new era of scalable Web3 applications that were previously unimaginable.

Let's take a quick peek at what's in store and what you'll take away from this course.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Understand zero-knowledge proofs in detail
2. Understand the blockchain scalability challenge and how ZK Rollups solve it
