# Understanding Zero-knowledge Proofs

Hello, Welcome back! Let's dive into zero-knowledge proofs!

## What are zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs)?

A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a way to prove something is true without actually revealing the details of what you're proving. It's like knowing the magic trick but not revealing how it's done! Let me illustrate this with an example featuring Waldo.

Let‚Äôs make this into a challenge. Try finding Waldo. As illustrated above, Waldo is a character with a distinctive appearance: he wears a red and white striped shirt, round glasses, and a red and white bobble hat. See if you can find him in under 2 minutes, if not the most I can do is to prove that Waldo is in fact present in the image üòÖ.

Let‚Äôs say I want to convince you that I know the location of Waldo in this image without revealing his exact position. Trust me if you‚Äôre going to try finding him in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zzI_4QHIiQV1e5J-QWQjG5YqqmOdh48Q/view?usp=sharing), it‚Äôll take a while üòÖ.

One thing I can do is place a black overlay on top of this image with a small circular cutout and show you Waldo. This will ensure that I can prove Waldo‚Äôs existence without revealing this exact location.

This is the basic premise of Zero-knowledge proofs. The ability to prove a claim without having to reveal the underlying details of that claim.

Basically, it's a system with three parts: a prover, a verifier, and a challenge.

- **Prover**: The party proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.
- **Verifier**: The party verifying the proof without revealing the secret.
- **Challenge**: A process where the verifier challenges the prover to prove their claim without disclosing the secret.

In this Waldo analogy, I'm the prover because I know exactly where Waldo is in the picture. You‚Äôre the verifier, trying to be sure that I really know Waldo‚Äôs spot without me telling you directly. The challenge here is the task of finding Waldo. By putting a black overlay with a small cutout to show only Waldo, I can prove to you that I know where he is without showing the whole image. This is just like zero-knowledge proofs, where one person shows they know something without revealing the actual information.

## Zero knowledge and web3

Zero-knowledge proof is one of the most powerful tools in the world of cryptography and blockchain. There are several reasons for this claim :

- **Enhanced privacy and security**
    
    It boosts privacy and security in transactions. With zero-knowledge proofs, you can prove a transaction is legit without giving away any personal details.
    
- **Scalability of blockchain networks** 

    ZKPs and zkRollups significantly enhance blockchain scalability by enabling off-chain computation and validation. ZkRollups bundle transactions and submit a single proof to the blockchain, dramatically increasing transaction throughput.
- **New applications and use cases**
    
    Zero-knowledge opens the door to additional web3 use cases. Think proving you own a digital asset without anyone knowing who you are, or logging in without needing a password.
    
- **Cryptography**
    
    In cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs are integral to protocols like anonymous digital signatures and secure multiparty computation. They enable secure communication and data sharing without exposing sensitive information.
    

Some of the use cases of zero knowledge are:

- **Password verification**
    
    When you enter your password on a website, zero-knowledge proofs can verify it without the website actually seeing the password. This keeps your password private and secure.
    
- **Financial transactions**
    
    Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that financial transactions are valid without revealing sensitive details such as account balances or transaction amounts.
    
- **Identity verification**
    
    Zero-knowledge proofs can confirm a person's identity without disclosing any personally identifiable information. This is particularly useful in sensitive contexts like medical or legal situations.
    

Beyond these examples, zero-knowledge proofs are finding application in a growing number of innovative blockchain projects. Emerging blockchain solutions like **zkVerify** are capitalizing on zero-knowledge proofs to unlock a new era of scalability and privacy-preserving applications.

## zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs

These are two of the most well-known types of zero-knowledge proofs, each with its own quirks and features.

- **zkSNARKs** 
    (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are known for their compact proofs and fast verification. They're great for quick checks in cases like blockchain transactions. But they also need an additional initial trusted setup.
- **zkSTARKs** 
    (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) are newer and focus on handling bigger and more complex proofs efficiently. They skip the trusted setup part, which makes them more transparent and theoretically safer in some ways. However, they tend to have larger proofs and can take longer to verify compared to zkSNARKs.

### Main differences

No need to worry if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with these definitions, Let‚Äôs simplify.

- **Trusted setup**
    - zkSNARKs: Requires a special phase at the start to create some initial settings securely, known as a "trusted setup.‚Äù
    - zkSTARKs: Do not require a trusted setup, promoting transparency and potentially improving security.
- **Proof sizes and speed**
    - zkSNARKs: Have smaller proof sizes and faster verification times, suitable for applications requiring quick responses.
    - zkSTARKs: Have larger proofs and take longer to verify, making them more suitable for scenarios prioritizing robustness over speed.
- **Succinct setup (Efficient initial configuration process)**
    - zkSNARKs: Setup time can vary but may take linear time or more depending on the implementation.
    - zkSTARKs: Usually get started quickly, in a way that grows slowly even as the system gets bigger ( Logarithmic setup time).
- **Scalability**
    - zkSNARKs: Efficient for certain scalability needs with verification time for proof-checking time growing slowly even as the system scales (Logarithmic verification time).
    - zkSTARKs: Provides quasi-linear proving time and logarithmic verification time i.e. proof-making time grows slowly and proof-checking time grows very slowly. It is suitable for handling larger and more complex proofs efficiently.
- **Applications**
    - zkSNARKs: Widely adopted in blockchain for their speed and efficiency in transaction verification.
    - zkSTARKs: Gaining traction in applications requiring high security and transparency, such as financial audits and privacy-preserving protocols.

## That‚Äôs a wrap

That's a wrap! We covered what zero-knowledge proofs are, how they work, their importance in Web3, and the main differences between zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. These concepts might seem complex at first, but they are key to enhancing privacy and security in our digital world. Keep exploring, and we‚Äôll continue in the next lesson.
