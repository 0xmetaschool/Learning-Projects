# ZK Rollups and ZKPs Fit Into Blockchain Scalability

Welcome back! You did great on learning all about the zero-knowledge proofs.

In this lesson, we‚Äôre going to discuss the big challenge blockchain faces and how that problem can be solved with zero knowledge rollups that use ZK proofs.

## The ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù blockchains face

The one most daunting challenge the ever-growing and ever-expanding blockchain technology faces is ‚Äúscalability‚Äù.

Imagine you're hosting a huge pizza party for all your friends. üçï Everyone's hungry and excited, but there's only one oven, and it can only bake one pizza at a time. This is a big problem because the more friends you invite, the longer everyone has to wait for their pizza.

This situation is similar to the scalability issue in blockchain.

As the blockchain grows and more complex applications are built on top of it, the system can face limitations in its ability to process transactions quickly and efficiently, leading to slower transaction times and higher fees. This is akin to your pizza oven having a limited capacity ‚Äì it can only bake a certain amount of pizzas at once. So, scalability is about making the blockchain capable of handling more transactions quickly and efficiently, just like figuring out how to bake more pizzas faster at your party.

## ZK Rollups to the rescue

Now, imagine you get a magic pizza oven that can bake multiple pizzas without losing quality. ZK Rollups work similarly for blockchains. They bundle many transactions together into a single batch, process them all at once, and then update the main blockchain with the results. This makes the blockchain much faster and more efficient without sacrificing security or decentralization.

In short, ZK Rollups help the blockchain handle more transactions quickly, just like a magic oven helps you serve more pizzas faster!

## So, what exactly are ZK Rollups?

Before we move forward, let‚Äôs take a step back and revisit ZK Proofs from our previous lesson. This brief recap will help all the pieces fall into place for a better understanding of ZK Rollups.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

Remember the "Where's Waldo?" analogy from our last lesson? Finding Waldo in the crowd without revealing his exact location is like using a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). We used a black overlay with a circular cutout to highlight the area where Waldo is, without pointing directly to him.This demonstrates the knowledge of his presence without giving the location away.

### ZK Rollups mechanism

Imagine you're checking a "Where's Waldo?" book, but instead of finding Waldo yourself, you have a helper who does it for you. Here's how this works:

- **Finding Waldo on each page:** Your helper looks through each page of the book
- **Bundling pages together:** Your helper puts sticky notes on all pages where they found Waldo and bundle them together.
- **Creating a summary proof:** Your helper writes a note saying "I found Waldo on 20 pages" without telling you which pages.
- **Verification:** You believe your helper's note without checking each page yourself.

ZK Rollups operate similarly:

1. ZK Rollups collect multiple transactions (like finding Waldo on multiple pages) off the main blockchain.
2. They then create a special cryptographic proof (zk-SNARK) that confirms all the transactions are valid.
3. This proof is sent to the main blockchain, which verifies the summary without needing to check each transaction in detail.

### The role of ZKPs in ZK Rollups

So, ZKPs are the magic behind this system. They allow us to confirm that all bundled transactions are correct while reducing the data stored on the blockchain, making it faster and more efficient.

In short, ZK Rollups use the power of ZKPs to bundle and verify transactions off-chain, ensuring privacy and speed, just like your magic box confirms treasures without revealing their secrets!

## Challenges in ZK Rollups

While ZK Rollups solve the scalability challenge they introduce new challenges. Let‚Äôs discuss those challenges and see what bottlenecks they present.

### High computational costs

ZK Rollups require complex cryptographic computations to generate proofs. These computations are resource-intensive and can be expensive, especially for more complex smart contracts. This cost can be a barrier to widespread adoption, particularly for smaller-scale applications.

### Limited support for new cryptographic types

The cryptographic proofs used in ZK Rollups, typically zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs, are highly specialized. Implementing support for new types of cryptographic proofs or upgrading existing ones can be challenging. This limitation can slow down innovation and make it difficult to adapt to new security requirements or more efficient proof systems as they emerge.

## Proof verification costs

This is something we already discussed but let me give you some numbers, according to Horizen Labs, ZK Rollups spent around $50 million on proof verification in 2023. This cost is expected to skyrocket to over $1 billion by 2028 due to the growing popularity of ZK Rollups.

L2BEAT reports that the ZK-Rollup sector boomed in 2023 with 20 active projects and 18 more launching in 2024. This is a whopping 90% growth, showing the sector's massive potential. With this rapid expansion, we expect the number of active ZK-Rollups to double each year from 2024 to 2028. By 2028, we could see around 500 ZK-Rollups, with proof verification costs soaring past $1 billion.

This shows how much verification costs we need to ZK Rollups at large scale which becomes problematic and expensive for the users to use.

## The power of zkVerify

Solving one issue using ZK Rollups introduces another challenge. To address this challenge, Horizen Labs introduced the zkVerify blockchain network to collapse proof verification costs.

zkVerify‚Äôs specialized proof verification layer has the potential to slash-proof verification costs by over 90%! If it had been available in 2023, ZK-Rollup users could have saved a whopping $43 million. Talk about a game-changer! As the co-founder of Horizen Labs mentioned:

## That‚Äôs a wrap

In summary, ZKrollups faces challenges like data availability issues, proof verification costs, and potential centralization risks. However, with new innovative solutions like zkVerify blockchain, these hurdles can be overcome to create a robust and efficient blockchain system.

In the next lesson, we will cover zkVerify in detail and understand what exactly it is and what are its goals.
