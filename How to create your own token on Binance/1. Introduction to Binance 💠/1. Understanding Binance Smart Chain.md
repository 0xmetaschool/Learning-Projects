## What is Binance Smart Chain?

Binance Smart Chain or BSC is **a smart contract platform launched by Binance based on the Go Ethereum (Geth) client** making it compatible with blockchain apps developed for the Ethereum network.

The Binance Smart Chain uses BEP20 as a standard for crypto tokens on its platform. BEP20 is the same as [ERC20 on Ethereum Network](https://metaschool.so/articles/erc-20-token/).
