# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ðŸŒž, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about building the blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we will learn how to create your own Binance token in 30 mins. It will be a simple, step-by-step process.

Why Binance? Daily active addresses and transaction are rapidly increasing in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which shows the rapid increase in the Binance growth.

Not only this, developers are actively deploying contracts on Binance increasing the contracts deployment 51.9% year on year basis, and full-time developers on the BSC Chain are increasing from 130 to 133 per year.

So this course will be great head start for you to become one of the BSC Chain developer and deploy and create your first smart contract on Binance.

Before we start, we need to understand a few things and trust me I'm not gonna bore you!

## Course overview

We will cover:

1. How to create an BEP20 token like Cake, Swipe etc

- How to use OpenZeppelin library
- How to use QuickNode to create your dApp
- How to deploy on BSC [Testnet](https://metaschool.so/articles/testnet-meaning/)

**Keep your momentum going! In lesson 3rd and 4th, weâ€™ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I canâ€™t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about building their own blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain ecosystem and [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/) because in this course we will focus more on building your own blockchain and skip the theory part.

## Prerequisites

In order to launch your cryptocurrency on Binance Smart Chain, you must also be familiar with several tools and have them installed on your machine.

- Remix IDE - to write and deploy our code.
- OpenZeppelin - BSC supports EVM so we will use ERC-20 standards.
- [MetaMask](https://metaschool.so/course/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) - to interact with the Binance Smart Chain.
- Chainlist - to connect with BSC testnet network.
- Some BNB tokens - we can get it from the faucet.

Donâ€™t worry! We will go through the installations in the upcoming lesson.
