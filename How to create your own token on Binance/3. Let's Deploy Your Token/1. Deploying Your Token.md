# Deploying Your Token

After we are done with our coding part, let’s proceed to deployment where we will be launching our token on BSC Testnet, just some clicks left before launching your token.

## Start deploying your token

Follow the following steps to deploy your token using Remix IDE.

- First, go to Solidity compiler, click on “Advanced Configurations.” There, you’ll find “EVM version” set to “default.” Change the version to “paris”. This step is very important otherwise Remix will throw an error of EVM version incompability.

- After setting up the EVM version, click on “Compile MyToken.sol”.

- After the compilation, click on “Deploy” icon right under solidity compiler on the sidebar.
- Select “Injected Provider - MetaMask” as Environment a popup will appear to connect your MetaMask wallet in “Enviroment” section.
- Select the account in which you received your free BNB from the faucet.

- Click on “Deploy” button to launch your token. Do not change any other value than “Enviroment”.
- A MetaMask popup will appear to sign the transaction. Confirm it and you have successfully launched your own token on BSC Network.

Let’s check if our token is deployed correctly. We're almost there, so excited!!!

- Scroll down and copy your contract address under deployed contract in Remix by “clicking the copy icon”.

- Go to  [https://testnet.bscscan.com](https://testnet.bscscan.com/) and search for your contract address.

- Hurray, our token has been created. Now let’s add our token to our MetaMask and check if we received our minted 1000000 Mango Coins.
- Go to your Metasmask, go to asset and click on “Import Token”.

- Paste your contract address, the rest of the details will be auto filled. Proceed to click on “Add Custom Token” and import the token.
- Now you will see your 1000000 tokens minted to your BSC address.

Hurrayyyyyy, so we have created our own token and this token is ready for you to showcase on your social media! Also for the Mainnet part you need to follow the same steps and just make sure you are deploying this same contract on it.

That's all 🎉

Also, for the Mainnet, you won't be getting free faucet BNB tokens so you actually need to buy the BNB token and transfer it to your wallet. This will be used to deploy your BEP-20 token.

## That’s a wrap

I really do hope this was an amazing course for you. Maybe you should check out our courses on creating tokens on other platforms too and if you want a course on creating a market for your token, let me know, and I might get to it? WAGMI 🚀
