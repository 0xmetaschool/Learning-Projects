# Writing Your Smart Contract

Now that you've set up…

Let's go to Remix IDE 🔥

- Go to [http://remix.ethereum.org/](http://remix.ethereum.org/) or open Remix desktop app anything you prefer
- **Click on create file** at the top of your file explorer panel and create MyToken.sol
- Now **click on MyToken.sol** and let’s add some code

So, your MyToken will have the following code and we will use the OpenZeppelin library, a smart contract template library, to write our smart contract and as you can see, we wrote only 5-6 lines to make our token!

```kotlin
The final code will look like this 👇🏼
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
constructor () ERC20("Mango Coin",
  "Mango") {
_mint(msg.sender,
    1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
  }
}
```

You can copy this code and change 🥭 Mango Coin and Mango with the name of your token and symbol.

Next lesson, let's goooo 🚀
