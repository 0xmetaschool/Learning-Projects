# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone🌈, I am Munim and I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about Avalanche for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own  ERC20 token in Solidity programming language and then deploy it on Avalanche blockchain. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to begin your exciting journey of coding in Avalanche using Solidity.

Let’s look at how you will be interacting with the token by the end of the course.

Why Avalanche? Avalanche is a blockchain platform that rivals the Ethereum blockchain. It supports smart contracts written in Solidity programming language to run dApps on its network. Big companies such as GREE, Deloitte, KyberSwap, GameStar+, and Encode Club have partnered with Avalanche to ship their projects on Avalanche.

Not only this, Avalanche has hit a major milestone with one million Monthly Active Users (MAU). And imagine being part of almost 270k active Solidity developers.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Avalanche blockchain
2. Learn to write ERC20 token in Solidity programming language
3. Set up MetaMask for Avalanche
4. Deploy the Solidity smart contract to Avalanche blockchain

## W****ho exactly should take this course?****

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about Avalanche blockchain and how they can deploy the smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and Solidity Programming language because in this course we will focus more on writing ERC20 token and deploying it on Avalanche blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Metamask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your Metamask if you still haven’t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
