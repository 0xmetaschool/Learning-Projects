# User Authentication, Profile, and Post Management

Alright! We've laid the groundwork for our decentralized social media playground, and now it's time to invite the first guests to the party. 🎉 In this lesson, we're diving into the essential steps of user authentication and profile management. Think of it like setting up the bouncer at the door (registration) and giving everyone a cool name tag (profile creation).  We'll unveil the smart contract functions that empower users to create their digital identities, waltz into our dApp, and showcase their unique personalities.

## Setting Up Your Project

First things first, we’ll check out to our right branch. Run the following command to be at the `boilerplate02` branch. Make sure you are in `build-social-media-dapp-on-core` folder.

```
git checkout boilerplate02
```

## Writing Smart Contract

Now we will upgrade our smart contract and add functions to our contract. Just like the previous lesson, we have a few assignments for you to engage you in learning and understanding more to build your dApp. 

Let’s code!

## createUser Function

This function registers a new user on the platform. It checks if the sender (user creating the account) already exists. If not, it creates a new User struct with the sender's address, username, and bio, and stores it in a mapping called "users".

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `43` with the variable that is required to complete a user’s profile. It might be a piece of 🍰 for you.

**Hint:** Well, the hint is it’s the variable that will store the info of the user and it’s also in the parameters of the function. 😉

## getUsername Function

This function retrieves the username associated with a user's address. It checks if the user exists (has a username stored) before returning the username from the "users" mapping.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `44` with the necessary keyword.

**Hint:** Hmm, the keyword starts with the alphabet `r` and it will provide the name of the username to its caller. You will get it right in a minute, good luck! 🍀

## createPost Function

This function allows a user to create a new post. It first checks if the user creating the post is already registered. If so, it increments a counter keeping track of the total number of posts, creates a new Post struct, assigns it an ID (postCount), sets the author address (msg.sender), stores the post content, and initializes the number of likes to 0. The new post is then stored in a mapping called "posts".

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `60` with the number.

**Hint:** If a post has been created, then what do you think should be the count of likes of that post? I know you know the answer, just it here and we are good to go. 💪🏼

## Compile and Deploy

Time to test our code by compiling and deploying it.

- First, let’s create a `.env` in the `build-social-media-dapp-on-core` directory and paste your private key against the `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.
    
    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=""
    ```
    
- Now let’s install all the dependencies and compile our contract using :
    
    ```
    npm install 
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
    
- Let’s deploy our contract using hardhat ignition just like last time
    
    ```
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network core_testnet
    ```
    

> **Make sure to save your contract address as we will need it later.**

## Frontend Interaction: Bringing it to Life

We deserve to see what we have coded in real-life interaction. So let’s see how we can do that:

- First, run the following commands:
    
    ```
    cd interface
    npm install
    cd src
    mkdir ABI
    ```
    
- Copy the `Metacircle.json` file from `artifacts/contracts/Metacircle.sol/`and paste it inside the `interface/src/ABI` folder.
- Navigate to `interface/src/contexts/Web3Context.js` and replace YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with your deployed contract address.

- Now run the following command to start your dApp. Make sure you are in `interface` folder.
    
    ```
    cd ../
    npm start
    ```
    

### Create your profile

Well connect your Metamask and add your info to complete your profile. Exciting?

### Create Your Post

You can also write your post:

## Push your code

Let’s push our changes to the `boilerplate02` branch. You can run the following commands. Make sure you are in the `build-social-media-dapp-on-core` folder.

```

git add .
git commit -m "Done with User Authentication, Profile, and Post Management"
git push -u origin boilerplate02
```

## That’s a Wrap

We've now unlocked the gates to our decentralized social media kingdom! Users can create their own profiles and posts too.

In our next adventure, we'll empower users with more functionalities. Get ready to unleash the true potential of your decentralized social network!
