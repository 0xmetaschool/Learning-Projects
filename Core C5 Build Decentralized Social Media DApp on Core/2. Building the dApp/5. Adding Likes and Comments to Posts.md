# Adding Likes and Comments to Posts

The excitement is building! Our decentralized social media platform is buzzing with activity, and it's time to unleash the full potential of community interaction. In this lesson, we'll complete the core functionality of our dApp by adding likes and comments, along with the necessary functions to retrieve and display this dynamic content. Get ready to witness the power of Web3 as we transform your platform into a vibrant social hub!

## Setting Up Your Project

First things first, we’ll check out to our right branch. Run the following command to be at the `boilerplate03` branch. Make sure you are in `build-social-media-dapp-on-core` folder.

```
git checkout boilerplate03
```

## Smart Contract Deep Dive: The Mechanics of Interaction

Let's continue our exploration of the smart contract functions that empower users to engage with your dApp.

## likePost Function

This function checks if the user exists and if the post exists. If the user hasn't liked the post before, it increments the like count, marks the user as having liked the post, and adds the user's address to the `likedBy` mapping of the post.

**Assignment:** We are back with an easy assignment. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `68` with the variable’s name that will be incremented when the user likes a post. Make sure to increment that variable too.

**Hint:** See the name of the function, it’s part of it 😉👍🏼

## unlikePost Function

Similar to likePost, but checks if the user has liked the post before. If so, it decrements the like count, removes the user from the `likedBy` mapping, and updates the user's liked status.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `75` with the appropriate variable.

**Hint:** It’s the one who wrote the post. 🤫

## commentOnPost Function

This function checks if the user and post exist. If so, it creates a new Comment struct, assigns it an ID, and sets the author's username, post ID, and content. Then, it adds the comment ID to the post's `commentIds` array.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `90` with the appropriate variable.

**Hint:** Well it’s the info that the commenter wants to write on post. 📝 And it’s also one of the parameters of the function.

## Checking Post and User Status

**isPostLikedByUser:** This function checks if a specific user has liked a post.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `99` with the appropriate variable.

**Hint:** Well it’s one who wants to like the post. 📝 And it's also one of the parameters of the function.

![core c5 (6).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/core-c5-build-decentralized-sm-dapp/5.%20Adding%20Likes%20and%20Comments%20to%20Posts/core_c5_(6).webp?raw=true)

- **isUserRegistered:** Checks if a given address corresponds to a registered user.
- **getPostAuthorUsername:** Retrieves the username of the post's author.

## getCommentsForPost Function

This function retrieves all comments associated with a given post. It iterates through the post's `commentIds` array and fetches the corresponding Comment structs from the comments mapping.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in Line `120` with the appropriate variable.

**Hint:** It’s the count of comments for a post. Did we initialize an array for that in the function? Check that out!

## Compile and Deploy

Time to test our code by compiling and deploying it.

- First, let’s create a `.env` in the `build-social-media-dapp-on-core` directory and paste your private key against the `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.
    
    ```solidity
    PRIVATE_KEY=""
    ```
    
- Now let’s install all the dependencies and compile our contract using :
    
    ```
    npm install 
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
    
- Let’s deploy our contract using hardhat ignition just like last time
    
    ```
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network core_testnet
    ```
    

> **Make sure to save your contract address as we will need it later.**

## Frontend Interaction: It's Showtime!

We deserve to see what we have coded in real-life interaction. So let’s see how we can do that:

- First, run the following commands:
    
    ```
    cd interface
    npm install
    cd src
    mkdir ABI
    ```
    
- Copy the `Metacircle.json` file from `artifacts/contracts/Metacircle.sol/`and paste it inside the `interface/src/ABI` folder.
- Navigate to `interface/src/contexts/Web3Context.js` and replace YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with your deployed contract address.
    
    ![core c5 (2).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/core-c5-build-decentralized-sm-dapp/4.%20User%20Authentication,%20Profile,%20and%20Post%20Management/core_c5_(2).webp?raw=true)
    
- Now run the following command to start your dApp. Make sure you are in `interface` folder.
    
    ```
    cd ../
    npm start
    ```
    

Now while the smart contract is the backstage crew, the frontend of your dApp is the dazzling stage where the action unfolds.

Let’s see if we can comment on any post! Try it and let us know!!

And like a post too!

![like post.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/core-c5-build-decentralized-sm-dapp/5.%20Adding%20Likes%20and%20Comments%20to%20Posts/like_post.webp?raw=true)

Experiment with the frontend and try to dislike the post, comment, like, post and see what happens!
