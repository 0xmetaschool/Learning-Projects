# Quick overview of the DApp

Hello and welcome everyone! In this lesson, we'll explore the core features and functionality of our project, including user management, posting, liking, commenting, and grouping. We'll also break down the key steps to bring our dApp to life, outlined in our handy checklist. So let’s get started.

## What are we building?

The dApp we are building is a basic decentralized social network where users can register, create text posts, like and comment on others' posts. Let’s get into a bit more detail about each function. 

1. **User Management**
    - **User Registration**: Users can register themselves by providing a username and bio. Each user is identified by their wallet address.
    - **Conditions**:
        - A user can register only once.
        - The username must be unique for each address.
2. **Posts**
    - **Creating Posts**: Registered users can create posts with textual content. Each post is associated with a unique post ID and tracks the number of likes.
        - **Conditions**:
            - Only registered users can create posts.
    - **Liking/Unliking Posts**: Users can like or unlike posts. The contract keeps track of who liked each post to prevent multiple likes from the same user
        - **Conditions**:
            - Only registered users can like or unlike posts.
            - Users can only like a post once and can unlike it if they have liked it before.
3. **Comments**
    - **Commenting on Posts**: Users can add comments to any post. Each comment has a unique comment ID tied to a specific post.
    - **Conditions**:
        - Only registered users can comment on posts.
        - The post must exist for a comment to be added.

Here’s how you will be interact with the dApp:

## The Checklist

Alright, let's get organized! Here's a rundown of what we need to do to bring our decentralized social network to life:

- **Set up the project structure**: We'll get everything in order and set up our project so that our code is tidy and easy to navigate.
- **Design the smart contract architecture**: We'll plan out how our smart contract will be structured for our dApp.
- **Create user authentication and profile management**: We'll make sure users can register and log in to their profiles securely.
- **Build the post creation feature**: Users will be able to share their thoughts and ideas with the community by creating posts.
- **Add likes and comments to posts**: We'll make it easy for users to engage with each other's content by liking and commenting on them.
- **Bringing it all together**: We will build and deploy our final smart contract and integrate it with our frontend boilerplate to fully build up our dApp.

That's it! Let's get started and make this dApp a reality.

## Wrap Up

That's a wrap! You now know what we're building and what's coming up next. Take a glance at the checklist, get excited, and let's dive in! We'll see you in the next lesson, where we'll start building our decentralized social network.
