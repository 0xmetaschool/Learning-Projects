# Wrap Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned till now.

## Building the Decentralized Social Media dApp

One of the most interesting parts of the course was that we built our very own Decentralized Social media dApp! We created functions to create posts, like, dislike, and comment on them - exactly how it is done in traditional social media dApp.

## Deploy and Interact with Contract

Another super interesting part filled with learning, was when we deployed a contract on Core and interacted with it through frontend. And that’s how we built a full-fledged project which not only creates a contract but also interacts with it through our frontend.
