# Let’s Recall Sui's Key Features

Great job on learning how Sui works in detail! I am sure that if your friends ask you about Sui you can easily answer now. Bear with me for the next 30 minutes, let me summarize what we have learned so far by going through the key features of Sui. We need to recall what’s so unique about Sui and how it differs from other blockchains. So, let’s recall that.

## Key features of Sui

Let’s discuss some of the key features of the Sui blockchain.

1. **Storing data in objects opens new possibilities:** Sui blockchain stores data in objects rather than storing it in the form of accounts. To recall, objects are like boxes that store different items of different sizes and each box will have a unique ID. Object helps developers to define, create, and manage the data with ease.
2. **Hassle-free sponsored transactions:** In Sui, one address can pay the transaction fees for the transaction that was made by another address. Especially if you're new to this, understanding gas fees and dealing with the transaction process can be a bit confusing. This helps the application builders to pay the initial gas fees for its users and makes the onboarding process so much easier for them. These types of transactions are called Sui-sponsored transactions.
3. **Consistent Network Fees:** Fluctuating fee structures are not intuitive to users. Imagine buying a coffee in the morning, then going to buy one in the afternoon and seeing that the fee is nearly as much as the coffee itself. Sui’s fee structure is designed to remain stable in dollar amounts and does not fluctuate throughout a 24-hour period.
4. **Develop in a Secure Environment:** Sui’s implementation of the Move programming language along with its object-centric design makes for a powerful and extremely secure developer environment. Not only is formal verification by the Move Prover required for applications to deploy, but there are many common smart contract bugs that are not even possible on Sui!
5. **Run transactions in parallel:** Sui’s unique data model allows for parallel transaction execution creating much faster time to finality for many transactions and allowing for the network infrastructure to remain resilient in times of high demand. This is super helpful when you want to solve a web2 problem using Sui as most of the web2 applications need to have fast processing systems.

These are not all the cool features Sui is offering, but for now, these are enough for you to know. Now, let’s explore more about how Sui differs from other blockchains.

## Sui vs other blockchains

Following are some of the unique features that make Sui stand out from other blockchains.

1. **High performance:** Sui offers great performance compared to other blockchains. Its feature to execute parallel transactions makes it much more robust than other blockchains.
2. **Security:** Sui's unique architecture offers great security even under bad circumstances. It smoothly handles the situation where validators get attached or deadlocks happen in the system. Sui offers great assurance to its users that their data will remain secure even if the network gets attacked, which other blockchains can hardly offer. Not only this, the Sui ecosystem constantly monitors the security threats to its community, and identified threats are immediately investigated and fixed to ensure user safety. Different organizations and people have done multiple security audits on different Sui features to ensure great security, for example, security audits on Sui core and Sui’s smart contracts conducted by Halborn. You can find more information on this on [Sui’s official website](https://sui.io/security).
3. **Easier developer experience:** Sui allows developers to create great, secure, reliable NFTs and dApps using Move programming language and object-centric approach.

## That’s a wrap

As we’ve explored Sui, you’ve probably realized that they have taken a fresh approach to many elements of blockchain tech. Whether it’s the data model, native onboarding tools, or tokenomics Sui has approached each with fresh eyes making for an exciting ecosystem.
