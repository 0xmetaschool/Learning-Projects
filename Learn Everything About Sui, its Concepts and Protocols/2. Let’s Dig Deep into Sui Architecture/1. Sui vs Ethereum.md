# Sui vs Ethereum

Welcome back, learners! In the last section, we gained a basic understanding and an overview of the Sui blockchain. In this section, we will understand how the Sui blockchain actually works. But before getting straight into it, let’s first understand how certain implementations in Sui are different from other traditional blockchains like Ethereum.

## Sui vs Ethereum

Let me give you a bird’s eye view of how fast the Sui chain is.

So what can we conclude from this? Let me walk you through each point one by one with real-world examples to make it easier for you to understand.

## Transaction processing speed

Sui has much higher scalability than other mainstream blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Sui is capable of handling a maximum Transactions Per Second (TPS) of 297,000, based on testnet stress tests. Why is this important? Well, if you’ve been around for a while you’ve seen what happens with limited transaction throughput on Ethereum – network fees increase dramatically as everyone is outbidding each other to try and push their transaction through.

Eg: Imagine you are in a restaurant where there is only one cook, it basically means the time taken for cooking will be longer. The cooking time of food can be slow and especially during high traffic times, there might be a huge waiting time. And hence, they would be delivering far fewer orders per unit of time. This is how legacy blockchains like Ethereum work.

Now imagine each individual’s order is assigned to different cooks who work independently of each other. This would speed up the order processing time substantially and hence deliver many more orders per unit of time. This is one reason why TPS is higher in Sui, validators can take care of different transactions than each other. Sui’s architecture is built for even greater TPS, a future upgrade will allow validators to add additional worker machines to quickly meet a surge in demand. This is like having extra off-duty chefs you can call on in case you need them.

## Move language

As I mentioned earlier Sui uses an object-centric smart contract language called Move which is a more expressive language which means it provides a flexible and detailed way to define how assets and smart contracts interact with each other which results in fewer security pitfalls, well-defined object ownership and less room for mistakes in your code.

This is a very crucial feature as web3 has witnessed several attacks due to such vulnerabilities. If I have to take an example I would go for the famous [DAO hack](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/coindesk-turns-10-how-the-dao-hack-changed-ethereum-and-crypto/) which resulted in $60m of stolen ETH and resulted in Ethereum being divided into two chains - Ethereum and Ethereum classic which recognizes the original Ethereum blockchain.

Move on Sui is already pre-built to prevent such vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, underflow, overflow, etc. Well, we will be discussing a lot about Move in the next course. Let’s now move on to the execution part!

## Execution model

Sui’s execution model helps it to process multiple transactions at any given time exactly like a multi-lane highway. We will understand how it achieves this using parallel transactions in more detail in the next section. But let’s get a basic overview here with our restaurant example.

To understand this, let's revisit the restaurant example we used while explaining the TPS concept:

- In a restaurant with only one cook (like Ethereum), customers arrive at a leisurely pace, with enough time between orders for the cook to handle each one. Even though it might take a bit longer to prepare each order, it doesn't significantly affect business because of the low traffic. But as the traffic goes high, the queue builds up and it gets hard for the restaurant to process the orders.
- Sui, on the other hand, operates like a restaurant with multiple cooks. Even if orders arrive with some overlap, each cook can prepare orders independently, without waiting for the previous one to finish. This parallel processing is what sets Sui apart and allows it to achieve a high TPS.

## That’s a wrap

In a nutshell, Ethereum and Sui are both Layer 1 blockchains, but they have distinct smart contract languages, transaction speeds, and execution styles. Sui's parallel execution makes it a top choice for high-throughput and scalable applications. We are sure, you might already be wondering how they are able to do this, and we won’t keep your curiosity on hold anymore! Let’s get right into it in the next section.
