# How Does Sui Even Work?

Now that you have gone through how Sui differs from Ethereum blockchain, let’s understand the basic architecture of Sui Blockchain and get to know how Sui manages to achieve such a high performance.

## How does Sui work?

Several factors play a crucial role in shaping the foundation of Sui and determining how it operates. Let's delve into what these factors are.

1. Objects in Sui
2. Object Ownership
3. Transaction Cycle

Let’s explore them in detail now.

### Objects in Sui (Move architecture)

Now that we have understood the significance of using Move, we need to understand the most fundamental component of Sui, objects.

**What are the objects?**

Objects are like structs in any other programming language. Each object can store any type of data whether an integer, boolean, or address. Consider objects like a box that stores different items of different sizes. Now each of these boxes has an owner, right? Each Move object has an ‘owner’ defined directly on the object itself. This means that the object entirely encompasses ownership information, with no need for ownership mapping to be paired with the asset as we see in other blockchains. There is more to object ownership, so let’s dig deep!

**Different types of objects**

In Sui, the two most common ownership types are single owner objects and shared objects.

- **Single owner objects:** In a single owner object, only a single address has the ability to transfer or use the object. Okay, but why does this matter? Single owner objects on Sui can bypass the lengthy consensus process and be finalized in less than a second! Now that we have gone through the technical explanation let me take through this concept using a real-world example.
    
    Picture this: a high-security, personal vault in a prestigious bank. This vault is exclusively yours, accessible only through a biometric system that recognizes your fingerprint. Inside, you store your most precious valuables — jewelry, important documents, and maybe even a rare collection of coins. Much like a single-owner object on Sui, this vault is under your sole control. You decide when to access it, and what to store or remove, without any need for consensus. Your actions with the vault are immediate and autonomous, mirroring the efficiency and security of single-owner objects in the digital realm of blockchain.

- **Shared objects:** Shared objects have no single owner but are either open for all users to interact with or a defined subset. Let’s take an example to understand this.
    
    Now, imagine a shared family heirloom, say, an exquisite antique clock, held in a family estate. This clock is a shared object, much like shared objects on Sui. Every family member has the right to access, use, or even temporarily remove the clock for special occasions. However, significant decisions, like selling or altering the clock, require a family consensus, and actions are taken only after collective agreement. This shared stewardship reflects the shared objects in blockchain, where multiple parties have access and a degree of control, but major changes necessitate mutual consent. It's about balancing individual desires with the responsibilities and privileges of shared ownership.
    

### Asset Ownership

Blockchains are cool as they give you the power to own and manage your digital assets, like NFTs (unique digital items), without any middleman. Let's explore how asset ownership differs on Sui.

**Ownership on Other Blockchains (e.g., Ethereum):**

Imagine Ethereum as a secure digital vault for your NFTs. These NFTs are kept inside something called a "smart contract," a bit like an automated vault. In Ethereum, an account is the basic unit of storage – there are the typical accounts that you think of (owned by a human) and those that house smart contracts. The NFTs you “own” are actually held within the smart contract account that they originate from.

Now, the contract developer can set the rules for this contract, just like specifying how your vault should work, but here's the catch: As an NFT holder, you don't directly control the NFTs inside it. To do anything with your NFTs, like lending or trading them, you need to engage with the smart contract and assume that the contract has granted you ownership rights to the NFT. Think of the smart contract as an intermediary, it helps you, but it can also make things a bit more complicated.

For instance, let's say you want to lend one of your NFTs to a friend. You can't just hand it over as you would a physical item. You need to use the smart contract to facilitate this process. This is the same for any other token on Ethereum as all tokens are deployed via smart contracts, even stablecoins.

**Ownership on Sui:**

Now, Sui takes a different approach. It's like having your personal art gallery at home. Remember that everything on Sui is an object with a defined owner, this means that the user actually has direct ownership rights to the object – no need to trust the smart contract the object originated from. These objects represent your NFTs, and the cool part is that they're stored directly in your personal account, just like your art hanging on the wall in your own secured home. You have direct control.

This direct ownership means you can easily lend your NFT to a friend or trade it with another user without dealing with a smart contract as an intermediary. Sui simplifies the process, putting asset ownership right in your hands. Since objects, like NFTs, often have just a single owner, we can leverage the benefits of owned object transactions, which is lightning-fast speed.

Now explore how transactions work a bit more to understand how owned object transactions can be completed so fast.

### Transactions in Sui

Sui processes the owned object transactions and shared object transactions in different ways.

**Owned Object Transactions**

For owned object transactions, like transferring a token, Sui does not require the network to reach a consensus before finalizing the transaction. This is because ownership of the object is defined directly in the object itself; so long as the defined owner is the one initiating the transaction, the transaction will be executed without waiting for consensus. Instead of relying on the typical consensus-related protocols for gossiping the transaction around the network, Sui uses a Byzantine Consistent Broadcast (BCB) protocol for owned object transactions. Unlike the traditional way of requiring validators to reach a consensus on the transaction validity, owned object transactions are able to be finalized without consensus, making them super quick.

Let me summarize the whole process for you,

- The sender submits a transaction to the network.
- Sui validators vote if the transaction falls in line with its requirements through a proof-of-stake mechanism.
- The sender collects the votes, creating an unsigned certificate that acts as proof of Byzantine Fault Tolerance.
- The sender shares this certificate with the network and all validator nodes verify its validity.
- For owned object transactions if the certificate is valid, the transaction is then finalized and executed.
- The user is returned the signed certificate which signifies transaction finality.

Owned object transactions also do not need to be sequenced before finalization, this means that unrelated transactions can be executed in parallel. For instance, think about Anna sending 1 NFT to Suzan and Ray sending 10 tokens to Tom. These transactions have nothing to do with each other. With Sui, they can be processed simultaneously and quickly, without the need for everyone to agree on the order.

**Shared Object Transactions**

Transactions involving shared objects, such as a DEX smart contract, require sequencing and consensus as multiple users could be attempting to interact with the same object at once. Thus, there must be some sense of transaction order. While shared object transactions must go through consensus, Sui’s novel consensus mechanism is still able to finalize transactions quickly. In Sui, there are two separate protocols for sequencing and consensus, which are called Narwhal and Bullshark, respectively.

The process is very similar to that of an owned object transaction, aside from the addition of sequencing and consensus before finalization. Let me summarize the process for you:

- The sender sends the transaction to the network.
- Sui validators vote if the transaction falls in line with its requirements through a proof-of-stake mechanism
- The sender collects the votes, creating an unsigned certificate that acts as proof of Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- The sender shares this unsigned certificate with the network.
- Sui validators then come to a consensus on the sequence and validity of the transaction output using Narwhal and Bullshark.
- The user is returned the signed certificate which signifies transaction finality.

In short, the process is pretty similar to that of owned object transactions until the signing of certificates. Shared object transactions require Sui validators to reach a consensus on the ordering and outcome of the transaction before signing the certificate.

For our family heirloom example, imagine one family member wants to sell an antique, but the other family members must agree before that action can happen.

## That’s a wrap
