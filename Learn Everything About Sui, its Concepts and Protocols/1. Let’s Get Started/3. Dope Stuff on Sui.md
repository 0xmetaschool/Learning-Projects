Let’s look at what exactly you can build and ship on the Sui blockchain in detail.

1. **Commerce:** Sui’s architecture and design allow for lightning-fast transactions that can even skip the time-consuming consensus steps. This is super useful for applications in the realm of commerce, as nobody wants to wait for consensus on their cup of coffee.
2. **DeFi:** Developers wanting to build DeFi applications in Sui have many unique tools at their fingertips – programmable transaction blocks, sponsored transactions, deep book, etc. – all with the speed, cost-efficiency, and throughput that Sui offers.
3. **Games:** As mentioned before, games are latency-sensitive and Sui can support extremely low-latency transactions that can be processed in parallel. Not only this, but Sui’s architecture is built to handle massive throughput demands - something extremely important to a highly played-game.

## Why should you ship cool stuff on Sui?

Since you've already understood how Sui is an excellent blockchain for building various things on-chain, it's high time you took a deeper dive into the Sui blockchain’s ecosystem.

Anyone can build high-quality dApps on Sui that are otherwise very challenging to build on alternative platforms.

If you decide to build your own product on Sui, you can submit a grant proposal to receive financial and technical support from the Sui Foundation. Even if you don’t submit a grant application, the teams at Mysten Labs, the Sui Foundation, and the Sui community are available to assist with any questions you might have!  You can join the Sui Discord community using this [link](https://discord.com/invite/sui).

**Fun Fact:** Sui offers various grants, including developer grants, education grants, and academic research grants. The developer grant program offers a range of $10,000 to $100,000 for qualified on-chain developers. You can find more details about it here: [Sui Grants Hub](https://sui.io/grants-hub).

**Don’t worry!** We will discuss how Sui works in detail in the upcoming lesson.
