# What is Sui and How Does it Redefine the Possibilities in Web3

Hey all, as I mentioned earlier, we will be starting with the concepts needed to build the best apps in Sui. I will do my best to help you all understand these key concepts before we dive into building some awesome projects on Sui. Grab your favorite drink and let’s get started!

## What is Sui?

Sui is a layer-1 blockchain, meaning that it is entirely self-reliant, handling its own consensus, execution, and security. Sui’s network architecture allows it to finalize transactions at lightning-fast speeds with consistent, predictable costs - essential elements for application builders. We won’t go too deep into the details of the network design, but the high-level, need-to-know info is this: Sui uses delegated proof-of-stake for Sybil resistance along with novel consensus and ordering mechanisms – Narwhal & Bullshark, respectively. Paired with an object-centric design, these elements of Sui’s network architecture allow for the benefits in speed and cost useful to both developers and end-users. This makes Sui ideal for latency-sensitive applications, such as gaming and fast retail payments.

**Quick Note:** "Latency-sensitive" means things that can't wait or need to happen really quickly. If you're playing a video game and you press a button to jump, you expect the game to respond instantly. In a world of fast internet and instant messages, we all like things to happen without any waiting, and that's being "latency-sensitive.”

Sui departs from the all-to-common (and sometimes problematic) Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) combo, opting for the Move programming language and the corresponding Move VM. The Move programming language was actually developed by the Facebook Libra/Diem team. The individual leading the development of the Move language, Sam Blackshear, actually is a co-founder of Mysten Labs, the R&D company supporting and developing Sui technology. At a high level Move was developed to create a more secure, asset-centric programming language purpose-built for blockchain use. We will dig more into the nitty gritty details later but for now, that's a good baseline to start learning more about Sui.

Here are a few points which summarize everything we have talked about earlier:

- Sui has novel consensus and ordering mechanisms – Narwhal and Bullshark.
- The object-centric data model of Sui is the bedrock for a unique and powerful developer experience.
- The Move programming language is used to write smart contracts in Sui.

## History of Sui

After a number of testnet iterations in 2022, Sui’s mainnet was launched on May 3, 2023.

You may remember the Libra/Diem project that Meta (fka Facebook) was built around 2020. If not, here's a quick primer: Libra/Diem was Meta’s blockchain that they built in-house with the aim to provide users with an extremely fast payment method with all the benefits of a blockchain optimized for payments. One hugely important thing that came out of this project was the development of a new programming language, Move. For better or for worse, Meta faced strong regulatory headwinds and decided to discontinue the project. Well, five leaders from the Libra/Diem project were determined to continue their work by extending the possibilities of what they had created at Meta and left Meta to create a new company Mysten Labs.

Led by five visionaries from the Libra/Diem project–Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias–Mysten Labs built Sui. As mainnet launch neared, the Sui Foundation was created with the goal of supporting Sui adoption and helping foster a thriving community around Sui.

After a number of testnet iterations in 2022, Sui’s mainnet was launched in May 2023. Since then, advancements of the chain have continued to be shipped by Mysten Labs along with a community of builders developing applications running on Sui.

## How is Sui different?

We learned a lot about what Sui exactly is, right? Now, what makes it different? Let’s see what problems Sui solves and what differentiates it from other blockchains

1. **Reliable Availability, Consistent Costs, and Easy Onboarding to support Mass Adoption**
    1. **Problem**: Broader blockchain usage has been limited as there are a number of friction points that hinder adoption by the masses. Networks have downtime, fees are often unpredictable, and onboarding new users to web3 is hard. Existing blockchains are all grappling with these issues, unfortunately, often in retrospect after a problem is observed. An effective developer platform cannot be chasing its tail addressing these issues, solutions need to be preplanned as much as possible.
    2. **Solution**: Sui has been built from the ground up with learning and observations from other blockchain ecosystems. Sui’s network architecture has been designed to be resilient in times of intense demand, the fee structure is designed to remain consistent for users to avoid unexpected changes, and the development team behind Sui has shipped tools for devs to address common challenges when building for the masses.
        
        Sui is building for the needs of the future with a fresh approach. When building a powerful application, you want to make sure that the underlying technology will support not only your current needs but also your future needs. By building a highly performant layer-1 with a fresh perspective, Sui offers a compelling developer environment for the next generation of blockchain apps.
        
2. **True Asset Ownership**
    1. **Problem:** It is often thought that anything on a blockchain associated with a self-custodial account is unilaterally owned by the account operator. This is actually not the case. For example, in Ethereum, any asset minted via a smart contract (i.e. ERC-20 tokens) never actually ‘leaves’ the smart contract. The user does not truly *own* the asset, they are just assigned rights to interact with it. While this might seem like an unimportant detail it actually has impacts on the user, which we will discuss when we dive deeper into objects and ownership in Sui..
    2. **Solution:** Now this problem can’t be solved by any blockchain because most of the L1s and L2s out there share a similar architecture like Ethereum. But in the case of Sui, assets like tokens are represented as individual "objects" with ownership defined directly on the object, not just as entries in a smart contract. This means each asset (e.g., a token or an NFT) lives independently from the originating smart contract. Users have direct control over objects and do not need to place trust in the smart contracts ownership mapping.

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, we have learned the basics of Sui, its origin story, and how it differentiates itself from other blockchains. If what you’ve learned here sounds intriguing, don’t worry, we’ve just begun to scratch the surface. After we learn more about what makes Sui tick, we will begin creating some really cool things. So, stay excited!

In the upcoming lessons, we will learn how Sui made it possible to be secure and scalable. Stay tuned!
