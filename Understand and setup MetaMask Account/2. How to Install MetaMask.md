# How to Install MetaMask?

## Download the extension

Go to the Metamask website and click on the "Get Chrome Extension" or "Get Firefox Extension" button. This will redirect you to the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons store, depending on your browser. Click "Add to Chrome" or "Add to Firefox" to download the extension. It's also available for Brave, and the new Edge.

## Create a wallet

Once the extension is downloaded, click on the Metamask icon in the top right corner of your browser. Click on "Create a Wallet" to start the setup process.

## Set a password

You'll be prompted to create a password for your new wallet. This password will be used to access your Metamask account, so make sure it is strong and not easily guessable.

## Save the seed phrase

You'll be given a seed phrase, which is a unique set of words that can be used to access your wallet and all your assets. It is important to keep this seed phrase safe, as anyone with access to it can access your wallet and steal your assets. It is recommended to write it down and store it in a safe place, or you can use a seed phrase recovery mechanism that Metamask provides.

## Get your Wallet address

Once you've set up your wallet, you will get a Wallet address, it will look like this example "0x9f8cfb2c5b7a3b3f3d7f5d5a5c5b5b5b5b5b5b5b5". You can use this address to receive cryptocurrency, just like you would with a regular wallet.

## Interact with dApps

You can also use Metamask to interact with decentralized apps (dApps), which are applications that run on the blockchain. These can include things like decentralized exchanges
