# Documents Management in Blockchain

Welcome back, rockstars! We’re so proud of you for continuing your journey with us! This is your fifth course on the Aptos series, like, wow, you’ve achieved so much so far!!

First, we’re going to discuss what we’re going to build in this course. This is going to be the advanced course in our Aptos series. So, buckle up, take an energy drink, and get ready for some excitement.

## What the hell is document management?

Before we proceed and start building, let's first understand what document management is. We'll begin by discussing the problem using an example and then explore how document management solves it.

### The Problem

You're about to launch a new product, and the team is dealing with many documents—contracts, design specs, marketing plans. But things quickly get messy. Files are scattered across emails, different folders, or even on various team members’ desktops. Tracking the latest versions, getting everyone to review and sign off, and ensuring nothing important gets lost or overlooked becomes a time-consuming hassle.

### The Solution

This is where document management comes in. Imagine you have a system that stores all these documents in one secure, organized place. Instead of hunting for the latest version of a contract, you can find it instantly. Your team can collaborate on documents in real-time, with changes automatically tracked so nothing gets lost. When a document needs approval, the system sends out reminders and locks the document once everyone has signed it.

## Documents management in blockchain

Imagine you managed to manage your documents in multiple Word files but is it secure enough that no one can change it? What if you accidentally share the edit link with anyone? They could change the sign, change what is written in the document, or anything else.

Here’s where the blockchain comes in. Blockchain can help you securely create a document and get it signed by anyone without allowing anyone to change the document's contents.

## Documents management dApp features

As discussed in the first lesson as well, we will create the dApp that can manage the documents from start to end on the Aptos using Aptos Move. 

We will build a contract that will be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parties need to sign a document before it is considered valid or completed. 

![Slide2.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/1.%20Introduction%20and%20DApp%20Overview/2%20Documents%20Management%20in%20Blockchain/Slide2.webp?raw=true)

For example:

- **Legal Agreements:** Where multiple parties must sign a contract before it is executed.
- **Approval Processes:** Where different stakeholders need to approve a document or proposal.
- **Multi-Signature Verification:** In cases where a document requires signatures from multiple trusted entities.

## Documents management dApp contracts

So, in our dApp, we will have only one contract, that can do all of the stuff we discussed above. 

The contract will have the following functionalities:

1. Initialize the store which we will use to store all the data of the document.
2. Create a document and allow users to create a document.
3. Allow users to sign the document with ease.
4. Allowing users to get the information on the document.

The following visual shows all the functions we’re going to implement.

One more thing, you must be confused that how are you going to save all the big content of a document in a variable of the contract. For this, we will utilize the IPFS. We will save the document file in an IPFS and then store the hash in our contract along with the signers.

## Where to use the dApp

This module is the perfect fit for those looking to manage documents with multiple signers in their dApp. Whether for legal, financial, or admin apps where trust is non-negotiable, it ensures that signatures are transparent, secure, and permanently recorded on the blockchain. If your app demands rock-solid trust and audibility, this module delivers!

## That’s a wrap

That’s it, folks!! You’re all equipped with the information of what we will build in this course. Next, we will begin construction and set up our environment.
