We’ve delved into the Aptos blockchain and mastered its programming language basics. We’ve even built a calculator, a fungible token, and a rock-paper-scissors game on Aptos! Now, it's time to take things to the next level with an exhilarating challenge. Get ready to unleash your creativity and skills as we dive into developing an advanced project: a thrilling dApp for contract management.

Just for your excitement, I have added a GIF that shows how we will interact with our token. But here’s the vercel link too so you can interact live with the dApp.

## The Aptos Move Contract

But why build a contract management dApp, you ask? Buckle up, because here's why:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Writing a contract is an engaging and practical way to grasp Aptos blockchain concepts.
- **Deployment and Interaction:** The excitement doesn't stop at coding! You'll deploy your contract onto Aptos, interact with it on the Explorer, and see your code come to life in a decentralized environment.

### Features of document management dApp

This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build the following functionalities of a contract management dApp on Aptos Move:
