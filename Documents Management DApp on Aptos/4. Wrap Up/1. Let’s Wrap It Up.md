## What We Covered

- **Introduction:** Got an overview of what we will build and the course structure.
- **Overview of Aptos World:** We revised why Aptos, Move, and its features are bringing change to the web3 world.
- **Aptos SDK:** We understood the Aptos SDK support for the frontend part and what features it has for us and how can we utilize them to create our dApp.
- **Getting Started with Development:** Learnt how to set up our development environment using the Aptos CLI. We installed the necessary tools and created a wallet.
- **Create, deploy, and interact with dApp:** We wrote the contract for our dApp and utilized the randomness feature of Aptos. We deployed it to front end and interacted with it.

Yes, we did this all! Cheers~
