# Setting Up the Dev Wizard

Awesome! This lesson is your personal tour guide, walking you through setting up your developer toolkit and even deploying your first smart contract on the Aptos testnet. 

By the end of this lesson, you'll have your very own coding playground ready to experiment with smart contracts, just like a kid with a brand-new LEGO set. So, let's get started!

## Tool  time: Gathering your gear

There are a few tools that you need to install to proceed with the course. Make sure you have the following:

1.  Download & Install:
    1. [Petra wallet](https://petra.app/)
    2. [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli)
    3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    4. [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Make sure you are using the Aptos testnet network in the Petra wallet.
3. Fetch some tokens from the Aptos testnet faucet by clicking on the faucet option available on your wallet.

## Setting up your project


Instead of building everything from scratch, we have made it easy for you by providing a boilerplate code. This will help you to start right away~

In your terminal where you configured your Git CLI - following the previous lessons, run the following command:

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/contracts-management-aptosc5 --clone
cd contracts-management-aptosc5
```

This will clone the boilerplate code of your project onto your system and fork the repository to your Git account as well. And we will change the folder to this cloned repo.

We will first make sure that we are at the right branch. Run the following command to be at the `boilerplate01` branch. 

```
git checkout boilerplate_01
```

At `boilerplate_01`, we have made a basic Aptos Move project for you with the basic move file. You’ll have to implement the code in those files.

The next thing we need to do is set up our Aptos CLI to work with our account. We'll use the `aptos init` command inside our directory.

1. You’ll be prompted to choose a network when you run the above command. Type `testnet` and press “Enter”.
2. Next, provide your private key we copied in the last lesson when prompted and hit enter.

And there you have it! The Aptos CLI is successfully set up.

## That’s a wrap

High-five, coding champ! You've just set up your Aptos Blockchain development environment like a pro. You've installed Node.js, VSCode, Aptos CLI, and connected your Petra wallet to the Aptos testnet.

That wasn't so scary, was it? You're officially part of the growing community of Aptos Blockchain developers building the future of decentralized finance. See you in the next lesson!
