# 2. Contract Management Functionality Frontend

Hey, welcome back! In the previous lesson, we completed our backend code and implemented the `HashSign` module. Now it’s time to see the solution to our assignments and add the front end to our code. Are you in it with me? I’m sure it’s a YES, so let’s go!

## Check the solution code

To view the solution and run our front end, we need to fetch the `boilerplate_02` branch of our GitHub repo. So, run the following command.

```
 git checkout boilerplate_02
```

If your code worked fine in the lesson then you’re good to go, If not please check out the solution code and try publishing it. You can find the solution code in the `hashSign/sources/HashSign.move` file.

Before publishing the contract, do not forget to update the `HashSign` address with your wallet address in the `Move.toml` file.

## **Frontend Prep-work**

We can create frontend using the command `npx create-react-app interface --template typescript` but will we? Well, it’s your choice, we already have a frontend setup in the git repo you cloned. 

- You can explore more about the frontend project creation from [Aptos’ official documentation](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp).

Run the following command to go to the frontend folder:

```jsx
cd frontend
```

Here’s what the frontend structure looks like:

## Important frontend

We’ll explore a few important files, the rest is UI and wallet handling that we have covered in [**Build Rock Paper Scissor Dapp on Aptos**](https://metaschool.so/courses/build-dapp-on-aptos). 

If you navigate to the `components` folder, you will find `ContractManagement.tsx` and `SigningDocument.tsx`. 

![aptos-frontend-2.png](2%20Contract%20Management%20Functionality%20Frontend%206de8b54460914bc58fc7a2a78718ebeb/aptos-frontend-2.png)

These files are important in terms of the front-end implementation of our backend code. Let’s see what these do.

1. The React component, `ContractManagement`, handles document management on Aptos blockchain. It allows users to create documents, add signers, upload files to Pinata, and submit transactions for document creation and signing. It also fetches document data, displays document information and pending signatures, and provides a sharing feature.
2. The React component, `SigningPage`, allows users to view and sign documents on Aptos blockchain. It fetches a specific document based on the URL parameter (`id`). It displays the document content, creator, status, and number of required signatures. The user can sign the document if they are listed as a signer and haven't signed yet.

## Set up the environment variables

So, now we need to set up the environment variables. Find the `.env` and start setting it up.

![aptos-frontend-4.png](2%20Contract%20Management%20Functionality%20Frontend%206de8b54460914bc58fc7a2a78718ebeb/aptos-frontend-4.png)

1. First, we have `VITE_APP_MODULE_NAME`. Please make sure that you use the same module name here you published to the aptos testnet network.
2. Do not change `VITE_APP_NETWORK`, keep it the `testnet` network.
3. Please use your wallet address for `VITE_APP_MODULE_ADDRESS`. Same as you used the wallet address as your module address while publishing the move contract.

## Set up Pinata IPFS

Next, we will set up the Pinata so that we can store our documents in the IPFS and use the API keys in the frontend.

So what is a Pinata? Its a peer-to-peer database storage system. Here, we save our data and access it using a URL. Unlike centralized storage, data in this system is distributed across multiple computers called peers. Okay so, here’s what we’re gonna do.

1. Sign up for Pinata
2. Create new API keys
3. Fetch the keys
4. Add the keys to the `.env` file

So, we have given you an overview here. Let’s move on to actually doing it.

### Signup to Pinata

Head over to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create a free account.

1. Click on the “Start Building” button. It will take you to the sign-up page.
2. Enter your email address, select “Builder” in the title section, and move “Next.”
3. Set your first name, last name, and password.
4. Confirm your email by entering the confirmation code.
5. Your Pinata profile is ready to go. Here’s what it will look like:

### Create new API keys

Next, we need to create new API keys so that we can use them to connect to Pinata in the front end.

1. Go to the “API Keys” section on the sidebar.
    
    ![pinata-1.png](2%20Contract%20Management%20Functionality%20Frontend%206de8b54460914bc58fc7a2a78718ebeb/pinata-1.png)
    
2. Click on the “+ New Key” button on the top right.
    
    ![pinata-2.png](2%20Contract%20Management%20Functionality%20Frontend%206de8b54460914bc58fc7a2a78718ebeb/pinata-2.png)
    
3. On the “Create API Key” page, enter your project name as the key name and give the Admin rights. Finally, click the “Generate API Key” button to generate the keys.

4. Lastly, copy the “API Key” and “API Secret” and paste them in the `.env` file.

```
VITE_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=YOUR_PINATA_API_KEY
VITE_APP_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=YOUR_PINATA_SECRET_KEY
```

## Run the frontend

Finally, we will run the frontend application now. Make sure you are at the `contracts-management-aptosc5` folder and run the following commands.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You will see the following page after running the app.

Connect your wallet, the same wallet you used to deploy the contracts and create a document by uploading the documents and adding the signer address.

![create-doc.gif](2%20Contract%20Management%20Functionality%20Frontend%206de8b54460914bc58fc7a2a78718ebeb/create-doc.gif)

After uploading the documents you can view the document in the “Your Documents” field. Now, go to the “Pending Signatures” field and click on the “Sign Document” to sign the document.

## **That’s a wrap**

Great work, rockstar!! You are all set! You’ve not only implemented the contracts but also integrated them with the frontend. You are awesome! Next, we’ll just wrap up the course and see what we have done so far.
