# Implement the Document Management Contract

Welcome back, rockstars!! Youâ€™ve been great so far!! Youâ€™re all set to code your first document management dApp in Aptos Move.

Buckle up and get ready to implement the Move code.

## Letâ€™s start implementing the contract

Head over to the `boilerplate_01/sources/hash_sign.move`. This is where we will implement the contract code for document management dApp. Please do make sure that you fill in all the code and donâ€™t miss anything.

### Import the dependencies

First of all, we will start with importing the dependencies that will help us implement the contract code.

### Define the structures

After importing the dependencies, we will implement the structs that will help build the dApp and store the important information.

### Define events

We have declared all the important structures so far. Now, we will declare the events but using the `struct` keyword that will have the `drop` and `store` abilities.

Now, you are done with setting up the basics. It is time for actual implementation now. 

Please donâ€™t forget to replace your code with the `YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE`. We have also mentioned the assignment numbers in the coding file and instructions for the code you have to implement in the comments for your ease.

### Define the constructor function

First of all, we will implement the constructor function. Letâ€™s call it `init_module`. It will take in the `account` as a parameter, initialize the `GlobalDocumentStore` struct and `EventStore`, and move them to the signer account.

Implement your first assignment here.

![hashSign-init.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/3.%20Building%20the%20Document%20Management%20DApp/1.%20Implement%20the%20Document%20Management%20Contract/hashSign-init.webp?raw=true)

### Define the create document function

Now, we will implement the create document function which will help us initialize the `Document` struct will all the information that we will take from the user. It will store the document in a vector array so that the document remains secure and the user doesnâ€™t get direct access.

Implement all the missing code and complete the 2nd to 6th assignments.

**Donâ€™t worry!** If you donâ€™t get the solution. We will share the full solution with you in the next lesson.

### Define the sign document function

The `sign_document` function will help us sign the document. This means we will use this function to get the signatures of the authorities. We will use the `Signature` struct here and the `SignDocumentEvent` to complete the signature process.

Implement the missing parts of the code and complete the 8th to 11th assignments.

![sign-doc.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/3.%20Building%20the%20Document%20Management%20DApp/1.%20Implement%20the%20Document%20Management%20Contract/sign-doc.webp?raw=true)

### Define the get document functions

Here, we will define three different function which help us retrieve the information of the document.

1. The `get_document` function will help us return the information of the document. The user passes the document ID to get the relevant document information.
2. The `get_all_documents` function will help us retrieve the information of all the documents
3. Lastly, the `get_total_documents` function will help us to retrieve the total number of documents created by the user.

Donâ€™t forget to implement the assignments. We tried to keep them easy for your ease.

### Overall, hereâ€™s how the contract works

This is how it will work:

- **Initialization:** A user will call the `init_module` to set up a `DocumentStore` in their account.
- **Document Creation:** The user creates a document by calling `create_document` with the document's content hash and the list of signers.
- **Signing Process:** Each authorized signer calls `sign_document` to sign the document. The system ensures that only authorized signers can sign and that the document isn't signed more than once by the same signer.
- **Completion:** Once all signers have signed, the document is marked as completed, preventing further signatures.

## Compile and deploy

Letâ€™s go ahead and deploy the contract you implemented using the CLI. 

### Update `Move.toml`

First things first, we need to add our wallet address. So go to the `Move.toml` and update `Replace_with_your_wallet_address_ðŸ”‘`Â with your wallet address.

![hashsign-movetoml.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/3.%20Building%20the%20Document%20Management%20DApp/1.%20Implement%20the%20Document%20Management%20Contract/hashsign-movetoml.webp?raw=true)

### Deploy the code

Now open a terminal in the `contracts-management-aptosc5` folder and run the following command:

```jsx
aptos move compile
```

The command will essentially compile our code and if the compilation is successful that means our code is mostly error-free and ready to be pushed to a network. The output will look like this:

![hashSign-compile.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/3.%20Building%20the%20Document%20Management%20DApp/1.%20Implement%20the%20Document%20Management%20Contract/hashSign-compile.webp?raw=true)

If you face an error while compiling the contract, try running the following command.

```
aptos move compile --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
```

### Publish the contract

The following command will publish our code to the Aptos testnet. While running the command, it will prompt you regarding the transaction fee payment, just add a â€˜yesâ€™ there.

```jsx
aptos move publish
```

And once that is done, the CLI will automatically publish the code to the Aptos testnet. The output will look like this:

![hashSign-publish.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Documents%20Management%20DApp%20on%20Aptos-C5/3.%20Building%20the%20Document%20Management%20DApp/1.%20Implement%20the%20Document%20Management%20Contract/hashSign-publish.webp?raw=true)

If you face an error while publishing the contract, try running the following command.

```
aptos move publish --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
```

We are done with the contract part. Letâ€™s explore how to use it in the frontend in the next lesson.

## Push your code

Implement the complete code of the `HashSign.move` contract and push it to the `boilerplate_01` branch. You can follow the following commands.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Done with the implementation of HashSign.move"
git push -u origin boilerplate01
```

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Phew!! Youâ€™re done with all the backend implementation for your dApp. Next, weâ€™ll check the solution to our assignments and start setting up the frontend.
