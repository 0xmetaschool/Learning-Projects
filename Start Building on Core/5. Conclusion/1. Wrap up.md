# Wrap Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned and how it can empower you in the world of blockchain development.

## What You Built

A Lending dApp on the Core blockchain. It had the following key features:

- **Staked USD to Borrow BTC**: You built the functionality of depositing **USD tokens** as collateral to borrow **BTC** tokens. It's like putting down a deposit to access funds within the Core DeFi ecosystem.
- **Collateralized Loans**: You maintained a minimum collateralization ratio, like staking 1.5 USD to borrow 1 BTC.
- **Flexible Borrowing and Lending**: You built the staking and lending functionality. Where in staking, the learners can stake USD to receive BTC tokens and repaid with interest within a set timeframe. Or can lend BTC directly to borrowers and earn interest.
- **USD Deposits and Withdrawals**: You learned how to manage the USD deposits and withdrawals based on lending or borrowing needs.
- **BTC Repayment**: You built how to repay borrowed BTC tokens with interest to unlock the staked USD collateral.

## What We Covered

We covered the following:

- **Introduction:** Got an overview of Core, the bitcoin-centric advantage, Core Blockchain programs, Solidity, and created a Metamask wallet.
- **Getting Started with Development:** Learned how to set up your development environment and installed the necessary tools.
- **Building Your Lending dApp Project:** We built the dApp and covered the Solidity basics, created structure, and studied mapping, functions, Interface, ERC20, constructors, and operators. We implemented functions to stake, borrow, and calculate interests.
- **Deploy and Interact:** We also learned how to deploy your dApp to the Core blockchain testnet and interact with it side by side.
