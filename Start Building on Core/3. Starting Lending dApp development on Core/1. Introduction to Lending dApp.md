# Introduction to Lending dApp

Letâ€™s now unveil what we are going to be building throughout this course. As we want to showcase Coreâ€™s security and innovative features, we thought of helping you guys create your own Lending dApp. And remember, in blockchain, every mistake is a new 'block' in your understanding! So, let's build something amazing and learn along the way.

## Features of Our Lending DApp

- **Stake USD to Borrow BTC:** Deposit **USD tokens** as collateral to borrow **BTC** tokens. Itâ€™s like putting down a deposit to access funds for various purposes within the Core DeFi ecosystem.
- **Collateralized Loans:** Maintain a minimum collateralization ratio to manage risk. For example, stake 1.5 USD to borrow 1 BTC.
- **Flexible Borrowing and Lending:**
    - **Borrowers:** Stake USD to receive BTC tokens and repay with interest within a designated timeframe.
    - **Lenders:** Lend BTC directly to borrowers and earn interest.
- **USD Deposits and Withdrawals:** Easily manage your USD deposits and withdrawals based on your lending or borrowing needs.
- **BTC Repayment:** Repay borrowed BTC tokens with interest to unlock your staked USD collateral.

Our Lending dApp lets you borrow BTC by staking USD as collateral, ensuring a safe collateralization ratio. You can also lend BTC for interest. Manage USD deposits easily, and repay borrowed BTC plus interest to unlock your collateral.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** BTC and USD in this context are custom mock tokens for our development purposes. They are not actual cryptocurrencies. We'll also include a faucet within our dApp to obtain these tokens for free.

## The Checklist

We want to ensure that you can learn the concepts of Solidity and the process of publishing smart contracts onto the Core Blockchain, So we will visit all the core concepts and procedures while building our Lending dApp step by step. So If you're looking to create a checklist for bringing our Lending dApp to life, here's what you'll need:

âœ… Using the basics of Solidity to build our starting smart contract from scratch.

âœ… Using mappings to store all loans taken by borrowers.

âœ… Creating functions to manage operations within our dApp.

âœ… Utilizing interface and ERC20 standards to interact with USD and BTC tokens (more details on this later).

âœ… Implementing constructors and operators to initialize your contract and manage operations efficiently.

âœ… Implementing stake and borrow functions.

âœ… Implementing functions for calculating interest and managing loan repayment.

âœ… Ensuring our smart contract is secure from common vulnerabilities and understanding best practices for secure smart contract development.

## Wrap Up

And that's a wrap for this lesson! We have explored all the exciting functionalities our lending dApp will offer, from borrowing BTC with USD as collateral to lending BTC for interest and managing deposits and withdrawals.

We also discussed the steps we'll be taking next to build our dApp from scratch. In the upcoming lesson, we'll dive into the code and bring our project to life. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and create something amazing. See you there ðŸ«¡!
