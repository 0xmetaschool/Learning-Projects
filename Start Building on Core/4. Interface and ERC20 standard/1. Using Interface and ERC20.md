# Using Interface and ERC20

Welcome back, code adventurers! In our journey till now, we built the basic skeleton of our lending dApp. Now, we're about to level up our Solidity skills with another two essential tools: interfaces and the ERC20 token standard. Don't worry if these sound a bit like magical incantations at first – we'll break them down in a way that's easy to understand.

Think of interfaces as blueprints that show how different smart contracts can chat with each other, and the ERC20 standard as the universal language spoken by most tokens in the blockchain world. By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to create more sophisticated and interoperable dApps on Core blockchain. It's like learning the secret handshake to the coolest blockchain club!

## The ERC20 Standard: The Universal Language of Tokens

Imagine you're in a bustling marketplace filled with vendors from all over the world. Each vendor speaks a different language, making it challenging to trade goods. But what if there was a universal language that everyone understood? That's exactly what the ERC20 standard is for tokens in the blockchain world.

ERC20 is a set of rules that defines how tokens should behave. It's like a universal dictionary that outlines the essential vocabulary and grammar for tokens to interact with each other. These rules cover everything from how tokens are transferred between addresses to how you can check your token balance. By adhering to the ERC20 standard, token creators ensure that their tokens can be easily used across different platforms and applications, promoting interoperability and creating a more unified token ecosystem.

### Why ERC20 is Awesome for Our Lending dApp

Think of it this way: if every token spoke its own unique language, building a dApp that could interact with them all would be a nightmare! It'd be like trying to understand a conversation between people speaking French, Mandarin, and Spanish all at the same time.

But thanks to the ERC20 standard, our lending dApp can work with any token that follows the rules. It's like having a universal translator for the blockchain world! This makes our dApp super flexible and adaptable.

## Interfaces: Your dApp's Communication Protocol

Now that we understand the importance of the ERC20 standard (that universal language for tokens), let's figure out how our smart contract actually talks to these tokens. This is where interfaces come in, and they're pretty awesome!

Imagine you're a language whiz who speaks every language on Earth. You walk into a bustling international marketplace. You can chat with the French pastry chef, haggle with the Egyptian spice merchant, and even order sushi from the Japanese fishmonger – all in their native languages!

**Interfaces are like your multilingual skills for smart contracts.** They let your contract "speak" the language of other contracts, even if they were written differently or by different developers. This is especially important when you're dealing with tokens.

### How do Interfaces Work?

Think of an interface as a blueprint or a contract. It defines a set of functions that any smart contract claiming to follow a certain standard (like ERC20) *must* have. But here's the cool part: the interface doesn't tell those contracts *how* to implement the functions, just that they *have* to have them.

**Code Snippet: Interface Example**

```solidity
interface IERC20 {
	function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
	function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
	function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
	
	// ... other functions ...
}
```

In this snippet, we're defining an interface called `IERC20`. This is the standard interface for ERC20 tokens – like a rulebook they all agree to follow. Notice how it only outlines the *signatures* of the functions (their names, inputs, outputs) but not the actual code that makes them work. That's the beauty of interfaces! They let contracts talk to each other without needing to know all the nitty-gritty implementation details.

Let's break down some key functions defined in the `IERC20` interface:

- **transfer(address to, uint256 amount):** This function is used to transfer a specified `amount` of tokens from the caller's address to another address (`to`).

- **balanceOf(address account):** This function retrieves the token balance of a specific account.

- **transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount):** This function allows you to transfer tokens from one address (`from`) to another (`to`) on behalf of the original owner (from), provided you've been given permission (`allowance`) to do so.

## Immutable Variables: Setting Things in Stone

In Solidity, immutable variables are like setting things in stone. They're constant values that are defined once when the contract is created and can never be changed. This is perfect for things like:

- **Contract Parameters:** Maybe the interest rate on loans or the minimum collateral ratio shouldn't change once the dApp is live. Immutables ensure these rules are set in stone.
- **Token Addresses:** You wouldn't want someone accidentally (or maliciously) changing the address of the token your dApp uses, right? Immutables keep these addresses locked in.

## Applying Interfaces and Immutables to Our Lending dApp

Now that we've got a solid grasp on interfaces (our communication blueprints for smart contracts) and immutables (our unchangeable constants), it's time to see how they work together in our lending dApp. We'll be using the `IERC20` interface as our bridge to interact with the tokens that users will lend and borrow (`USD` and `BTC` in this case). And, to make sure our lending rules stay rock solid, we'll use immutable variables to lock down key parameters like interest rates and collateral requirements.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
contract CoreLoanPlatform {
	// Interface Variables
	IERC20 public immutable USD;
	IERC20 public immutable BTC;
}
```

Let's break this code down:

**The ERC20 Connection**

First, we import the `IERC20` interface from OpenZeppelin, a reputable library of battle-tested smart contracts. This interface is like a universal translator that allows our contract to understand and interact with any `ERC20` token.

**Our Token Champions: USD and BTC**

Next, we declare two special variables called `USD` and `BTC`. They are of the `IERC20` type, which means they're not just basic addresses but powerful tools that know how to "talk" to `ERC20` tokens. We want our dApp to specifically work with `USD` (a stablecoin on Core blockchain) as collateral and `BTC` as the borrowing asset.

Notice the `public immutable` keywords:

- **public:** This means anyone can see the addresses of the USD and BTC contracts that our dApp is using. Transparency is key in the world of decentralized finance!
- **immutable:** This is like putting these addresses in a safety deposit box. Once set in the constructor, they can't be changed – ever! This is crucial for security, preventing any funny business like someone trying to swap out your trusted tokens for dodgy ones.

## Our Lending dApp Smart Contract (So Far)

Let's take a look at how our smart contract is shaping up with the concepts we've discussed: interfaces, the ERC20 standard, immutables, mappings, structs, and function outlines:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
contract CoreLoanPlatform {

	// Interfaces for ERC20 tokens
	IERC20 public immutable USD;
	IERC20 public immutable BTC;

	// Loan Parameters (Immutable Constants)
	uint256 public constant COLLATERAL_RATIO = 150; // 150% collateralization
	uint256 public constant BORROWABLE_RATIO = 80; // 80% of collateral can be borrowed
	uint256 public constant INTEREST_RATE = 5; // 5% interest rate
	uint256 public constant LOAN_DURATION = 30 days;
	uint256 private totalStaked = 0; //Counter for total staked
	uint256 private totalBorrowed = 0; //Counter for total borrowed

	// Loan Struct
		struct Loan {
		uint256 amount;    // Amount of USD borrowed
		uint256 collateral;   // Amount of BTC deposited as collateral
		uint256 startTimeStamp; // Timestamp of loan initiation
		bool active;      // Status of the loan (true = active, false = repaid)
	}
	
	// Mappings to Store Loan and Balance Data
	mapping(address => Loan) public loans;  // Maps borrower's address to their loan details
	mapping(address => uint256) public lenderBalances; // Maps lender's address to their BTC balance
	
	// Function Declarations (Placeholders)
	function depositCollateral(uint256 amount) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for deposting Collateral
	}
	
	function withdrawCollateral(uint256 amount) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for withdrawing Collateral
	}
	
	function withdrawBTC(uint256 amount) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for withdrawing BTC
	}
	
	function getBorrowableAmount(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching borrowable amount
	}
	
	function getUserCollateral(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching user's collateral amount
	}
	
	function borrowBTC(uint256 amount) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for borrowing BTC
	}
	
	function depositBTC(uint256 amount) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for deposting BTC
	}
	
	function repayLoan(address user) external {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for repaying Loan
	}
	
	function calculateInterest(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for calculating interest
	}
	
	function getLoanDetails(address borrower) external view returns (Loan memory) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching loan of specific borrower
	}
	
	function getLenderBalance(address lender) external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for getting the Lender balance
	}
	
	function getTotalStaked() external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching total staked amount
	}
	
	function getTotalBorrowed() external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching total borrowed amount
	}
	
	function getCurrentApy() external pure returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching current APY
	}
	
	function getUserBorrowed(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching a User's borrowed amount
	}
	
	function getUserStaked(address user) external view returns (uint256)  {
	// TODO : Implement Logic for fetching a User's Staked amount
	}

}
```

## Compiling and Deploying Your Upgraded Contract

Now that you've added interfaces and immutables to your contract, it's time to compile and deploy it! Follow these steps:

**Compile:**

```solidity
npx hardhat compile
```

![img](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Core%20C2%20assets%20-%20Start%20Building%20on%20Core/Core%20C2%20L9%20Image%206.png?raw=true)

**Write the Deploy Script:**

Now in the `ignition/modules/Deploy.js` file, paste the following code for deploying your contract

```solidity
const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");
module.exports = buildModule("CoreLoanPlatform", (m) => {
	const CoreLoanPlatform = m.contract("CoreLoanPlatform");
	return { CoreLoanPlatform };
});
```

**Deploy to a Testnet:**

Once the `Deploy.js` script is set, make sure you remove the `./ignition/deployments` folder if it exists and then open a terminal in the root directory of your project and run the following command:

```solidity
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Deploy.js --network core_testnet
```

This will return the following output:

## Pushing It to Git

As always, remember to push your to your github repository using the following commands:

```solidity
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/Branch1
```
