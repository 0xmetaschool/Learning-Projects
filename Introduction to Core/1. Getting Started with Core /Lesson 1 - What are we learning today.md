# What are we learning today?

Hello everyone ☀️

Exciting news: we're kicking off our first-ever course on Core blockchain’s learning track at Metaschool! Core is all about leveling up security, decentralization, AND scalability. We are super excited to have you with us on this journey to learn and build on Core!

Btw, following official github repos of blockchains and interacting with it is a great idea. Blockchains airdrop and consistently reward their followers. Do follow Core [here](https://github.com/coredao-org).

So, Why Core? At the time of writing, Core has already hit [258M+ transactions on-chain](https://scan.coredao.org/) and [5M active wallets](https://scan.coredao.org/chart/active-address). Not only this, it has a strong community of [267k discord members](https://discord.com/invite/coredaoofficial) and a strong following on [X of 2.3M.](https://x.com/Coredao_Org)

Another exciting aspect is that Core is the world’s first most Bitcoin-aligned Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it leverages Bitcoin's robust security while also offering smart contract functionality. This allows Bitcoin holders to stake their coins and earn passive income, while also opening up a world of possibilities for building decentralized applications on the blockchain. Yep! I hear you, they are pretty dope and we don’t want you to miss out on them.

But hold your horses before you hit that next button! Let's quickly take a peek at what's in store and what goodies you'll take away from this course.
