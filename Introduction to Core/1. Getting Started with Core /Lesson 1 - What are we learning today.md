# What are we learning today?

Hello everyone ‚òÄÔ∏è

Exciting news: we're kicking off our first-ever course of Core blockchain‚Äôs learning track at Metaschool! Core is all about leveling up security, decentralization, AND scalability. We are super excited to have you with us on this journey to learn and build on Core!

So, Why Core? At the time of writing, Core has already hit [258M+ transactions on-chain](https://scan.coredao.org/) and [5M active wallets](https://scan.coredao.org/chart/active-address). Not only this, it has a strong community of [267k discord members](https://discord.com/invite/coredaoofficial) and a strong following on [X of 2.3M.](https://x.com/Coredao_Org)

Another exciting aspect is that Core is the world‚Äôs first most Bitcoin-aligned Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it leverages Bitcoin's robust security while also offering smart contract functionality. This allows Bitcoin holders to stake their coins and earn passive income, while also opening up a world of possibilities for building decentralized applications on the blockchain. Yep! I hear you, they are pretty dope and we don‚Äôt want you to miss out on them.
