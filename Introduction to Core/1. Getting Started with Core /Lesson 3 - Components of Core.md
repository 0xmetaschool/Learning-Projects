# Components of Core

Welcome back, crypto explorers! We've just explored the features and primary goal of Core, which combines Bitcoin's rock-solid security with the flexibility of smart contracts to create a powerful DeFi platform. Now, get ready to dive deeper into the heart of this revolutionary technology. Let's unravel the mysteries of Satoshi Plus, the groundbreaking and innovative consensus mechanism that powers Core, and explore the key roles that keep the ecosystem running smoothly. This is where the real adventure begins! So why wait, let’s dive right into it!

## Introduction to Satoshi Plus Consensus Mechanism

Core's power lies in its unique consensus mechanism, Satoshi Plus, a multifaceted approach that revolutionizes the blockchain landscape by seamlessly integrating the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum's technological advancements. This innovative mechanism has three fundamental components, each contributing to a secure, efficient, and decentralized blockchain ecosystem:

- **Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW):** This is where Bitcoin's immense computing power comes into play. Bitcoin miners, who are constantly working to secure the Bitcoin network, can also lend their strength to the Core network, acting as security guards for this new city, without needing to invest in any extra equipment or resources. This not only makes Core more secure but also provides an additional income stream for Bitcoin miners in the form of CORE tokens.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** This is where you, the everyday crypto holder, can get involved. By staking your CORE tokens (Core's native currency) or even your Bitcoin, you're essentially vouching for the credibility of certain "validators." These validators are responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain's integrity. The more tokens staked with a validator, the more likely they are to be elected to do this important work. It's like a democratic election where your vote matters, but in this case, your vote is backed by your financial stake in the network.
- **Non-Custodial BTC Staking**: Here's where Core truly stands out. It is the first and only blockchain to offer a groundbreaking feature called Non-Custodial BTC Staking. This unique innovation sets Core apart from other blockchains by allowing Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC directly on Core without relinquishing control of their assets. It's like earning interest on your savings without having to deposit your money in a bank. You get to actively participate in the Core ecosystem, earn rewards in CORE tokens, and still retain full ownership and control over your Bitcoin. It's a win-win scenario for both Bitcoin holders and the Core network, as it enhances security while providing a new way for Bitcoin holders to put their assets to work.

## Major Components and Roles

Core is more than just a technology; it's a vibrant ecosystem with diverse key roles:

- **Validators:** They are the heart of Core ecosystem, responsible for processing transactions and maintaining the blockchain's integrity. They are elected based on a combination of community trust (staked CORE and Bitcoin) and technical capability (delegated hash power). Think of them as the city council, chosen for their experience, reliability, and popularity.
- **Verifiers:** These are the network's watchdogs, ensuring that validators are doing their job correctly. They monitor the network for any suspicious activity and report any issues they find, just like vigilant citizens who keep an eye on their elected officials.
- **Relayers:** These specialized nodes are crucial for connecting the Bitcoin and Core blockchain. They monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for events relevant to Core, such as Bitcoin deposits for minting coreBTC or Bitcoin transactions for releasing staked Bitcoin. Relayers then submit cryptographic proofs of these events to Core, ensuring the trustless and secure movement of assets between the two chains.
- **CORE token Holders:** The community members who hold CORE tokens and actively participate in the network's governance through staking and voting. They're the voters who have a direct say in how the city is run.
- **Bitcoin Holders:** They can participate in the Core ecosystem by staking their BTC, earning rewards, and contributing to the network's security.
- **Bitcoin Miners:** By lending their computing power to Core’s validators, they contribute to the network's security and earn a share of the rewards. They're like the city's security forces, protecting it from external threats while getting paid for their services.

## Bitcoin Alignment: Honoring the Original Vision

Core isn't just about creating a new blockchain; it's about staying true to the original vision of Bitcoin. Core is committed to upholding the principles of decentralization, security, and open access that Bitcoin embodies. By leveraging Bitcoin's security and involving the Bitcoin community, Core strives to build a bridge between the past and future of Blockchain interoperability. Think of it as building a high-speed rail network that connects Bitcoin, the established city, to the new and innovative city of Core, facilitating trade and collaboration between them.

## Wrap Up

Alright, crypto explorers, we've just scratched the surface of the Core ecosystem. Focusing on both security, scalability and fostering a truly inclusive community, Core is paving the way for a more decentralized, robust, and innovative future. But what were the exact events that led to the creation of this revolutionary blockchain? Let's journey back in time and explore the history of Core in our next lesson.
