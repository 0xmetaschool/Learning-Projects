# Let‚Äôs Wrap Up the Course

Alrighty, folks, it's time to break out the confetti and party hats! üéâ Can you believe it? You've reached the finish line, and let me tell you, it's no small feat. Pat yourselves on the back for sticking with it and rocking this course like pros!

Now, let's take a little trip down memory lane and soak in all the awesome knowledge you've soaked up along the way.

## What we learnt so far

In this course, we got a thorough understanding of the Core blockchain. Let‚Äôs see what we covered:

- We dove headfirst into its history and got cozy with the why behind its creation.
- From security focus to its scalability dreams, we explored how Core has been shaped.
- We rolled up our sleeves and got our hands dirty understanding the movers and shakers behind the scenes: validators, miners, stakers, relayers, and verifiers.
- We learnt about the Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism. It's like the coolest blend of Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work, Delegated Proof of Stake and Non-Custodial BTC Staking making sure our blockchain stays secure.
- We also got an understanding of the Core network workflow and infrastructure of Core.
- Last but not least, we also got a sneak peek at the many exciting apps being built on Core, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and games to exchanges and wallets.
