# Wrap Up

Congratulations! You've successfully completed your journey in creating a Lending dApp on the MANTRA Chain. Take a moment to celebrate your achievement ‚Äì you've mastered a complex blend of blockchain technology, smart contract development, and frontend integration. Let's recap the incredible skills you've acquired.

## What You Built

A Lending dApp on the MANTRA blockchain. It had the following key features:

- **Staked USD to Borrow TestOM**: You built the functionality of depositing **USD tokens** as collateral to borrow **TestOM** tokens. It's like putting down a deposit to access funds within the Core DeFi ecosystem.
- **Collateralized Loans**: You maintained a minimum collateralization ratio, like staking 1.5 USD to borrow 1 **TestOM**.
- **Flexible Borrowing and Lending**: You built the staking and lending functionality. Where in staking, the learners can stake USD to receive **TestOM** tokens and repaid with interest within a set timeframe. Or can lend **TestOM** directly to borrowers and earn interest.
- **USD Deposits and Withdrawals**: You learned how to manage the USD deposits and withdrawals based on lending or borrowing needs.
- **TestOM Repayment**: You built how to repay borrowed **TestOM** tokens with interest to unlock the staked USD collateral.

We built and deployed this dApp! Congratulations once again on your achievement! You're now part of a select group of developers at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. Keep exploring, keep creating, and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain technology!
