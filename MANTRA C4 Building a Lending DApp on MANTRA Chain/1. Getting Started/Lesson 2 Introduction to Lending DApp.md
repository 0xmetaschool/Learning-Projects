# Introduction to Lending DApp

Letâ€™s now unveil what we are going to be building throughout this course. As we want to showcase MANTRAâ€™s security and innovative features, we thought of helping you guys create your Lending dApp. And remember, in blockchain, every mistake is a new 'block' in your understanding! So, let's build something amazing and learn along the way.

## Features of our Lending dApp

- **Stake USD to Borrow TestOM:** Deposit **USD tokens** as collateral to borrow **TestOM** tokens. Itâ€™s like putting down a deposit to access funds for various purposes within the MANTRA DeFi ecosystem.
- **Collateralized Loans:** Maintain a minimum collateralization ratio to manage risk. For example, stake 1.5 USD to borrow 1 TestOM.
- **Flexible Borrowing and Lending:**
    - **Borrowers:** Stake USD to receive TestOM tokens and repay with interest within a designated timeframe.
    - **Lenders:** Lend TestOM directly to borrowers and earn interest.
- **USD Deposits and Withdrawals:** Easily manage your USD deposits and withdrawals based on your lending or borrowing needs.
- TestOM **Repayment:** Repay borrowed TestOM tokens with interest to unlock your staked USD collateral.

Our Lending dApp lets you borrow TestOM by staking USD as collateral, ensuring a safe collateralization ratio. You can also lend TestOM for interest. Manage USD deposits easily, and repay borrowed TestOM plus interest to unlock your collateral.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** TestOM and USD in this context are custom mock tokens for our development purposes. They are not actual cryptocurrencies.

## The Checklist

If you're looking to create a checklist for bringing our Lending dApp to life, here's what you'll need:

âœ…  Utilizing interface and CW20 standards to create USD and TestOM tokens.

âœ…  Implementing stake and unstake functions.

âœ…  Implementing borrow and repay functions.

## Thatâ€™s  wrap

And that's a wrap for this lesson! We have explored all the exciting functionalities our lending dApp will offer, from borrowing TestOM with USD as collateral to lending TestOM for interest and managing deposits and withdrawals.

We also discussed the steps we'll be taking next to build our dApp from scratch. In the upcoming lesson, we'll dive into the code and bring our project to life. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and create something amazing. See you there ðŸ«¡!
