# The Grand Finale: A Deep Dive into App.jsx

Hey there, dApp developers! 👋 We're in the home stretch of our lending dApp journey. We've explored the chain configuration, dived deep into our `useLendingContract` hook, and built out our main components. Now, it's time to see how everything comes together in our `App.jsx` file. Ready to see the big picture? Let's dive in!

## Imports: Gathering Our Tools

```jsx
import { Box, useColorMode, Container, Button, useToast, Flex, Spacer, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons";
import { useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect } from "graz";
import { checkKeplrInstalled, getKeplrInstallUrl } from './utils/keplrUtils';
// ... other imports for pages and routing
```

We're bringing in everything we need to build our interface. Chakra UI gives us our building blocks for the interface, Graz provides our wallet connectivity tools, and we've got our pages and routing components ready to go.

## Component Setup and Hooks

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const { data: account, isConnected, isConnecting, isReconnecting } = useAccount();
  const { connect } = useConnect();
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();
  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();
  const toast = useToast();
```

Here we're setting up all the hooks we need. We're tracking the wallet connection status, handling the theme mode, and setting up our notification system.

## Wallet Connection Function

```jsx
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (!checkKeplrInstalled()) {
    const installUrl = getKeplrInstallUrl();
    if (window.confirm("Keplr wallet is not installed. Would you like to install it now?")) {
      window.open(installUrl, '_blank');
    }
  } else {
    try {
      await connect({ chainId: "mantra-dukong-1" });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to connect:", error);
      showToast("Failed to connect. Please make sure Keplr is set up correctly.", "error");
    }
  }
};
```

This function handles everything about connecting to Keplr. It checks if Keplr is installed, helps users install it if needed, and handles the connection process with proper error management.

## Toast Notification Function

```jsx
const showToast = (message, status) => {
  toast({
    title: status === "error" ? "Error" : "Success",
    description: message,
    status: status,
    duration: 3000,
    isClosable: true,
  });
};
```

A simple yet effective way to show feedback to users. Whether something succeeds or fails, they'll know about it.

## The Return Statement: Building Our UI

In our return statement, we're putting everything together. The structure looks like this:

```jsx
return (
  <Router>
    <Box minH="100vh" minW="100vw">
      {/* Navigation with wallet connection and theme toggle */}
      <Box py={4} px={8} boxShadow="md">
        {/* Navigation content */}
      </Box>

      {/* Routes for our pages */}
      <Container maxW="container.xl" py={8}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/stake" element={<Stake />} />
          <Route path="/borrow-repay" element={<BorrowRepay />} />
        </Routes>
      </Container>
    </Box>
  </Router>
);
```

This creates our basic application layout with navigation and routing. The navigation bar has wallet connection handling and theme toggling, while the main content area shows whichever page component matches the current route.

## Running the frontend

To start up your frontend, navigate to your project directory and run:

```
npm run dev
```

## Wrapping Up

Phew! That was quite a journey through our `App.jsx` file. Let's recap what we've learned:

1. We've set up the overall structure of our app, including navigation and routing.
2. We've implemented wallet connectivity with error handling.
3. We've added a light/dark mode toggle for user preference.
4. We've created a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

This `App.jsx` file is the command center of our dApp, bringing together all the individual components we've built and providing a seamless user experience. As you continue to develop your dApp, you'll likely come back to this file to add new features or refine existing ones.

Great job making it this far! You now have a solid understanding of how to structure a React-based dApp. Keep experimenting, keep learning, and most importantly, keep building. The world of blockchain development is waiting for your innovations! Happy coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻
