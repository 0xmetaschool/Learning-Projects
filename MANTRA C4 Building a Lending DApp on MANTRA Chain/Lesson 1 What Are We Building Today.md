# What Are We Building Today

Hey there, MANTRA masters! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome back to the exciting world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world assets (RWAs)! We're stoked you conquered our first three courses and are ready to level up your MANTRA Chain skills.  ðŸŽ‰

In this course, we're not just dipping our toes; we're diving headfirst into the world of building decentralized applications (dApps) on MANTRA Chain. Think about it: fractional ownership of real estate, art, commodities, and moreâ€”all enabled by the secure, transparent infrastructure of MANTRA Chain, designed to foster compliant tokenization and trading. This course is your toolkit for turning these possibilities into reality!

Remember all the awesome stuff we covered in the first course? The Cosmos ecosystem, the ins and outs of RWAs, the importance of regulatory compliance, and MANTRA's vision to merge TradFi and DeFi, as well as its architecture? Well, this course builds on that foundation, empowering you to create dApps that truly leverage the power of MANTRA Chain.

## The Lending DApp: Your Launchpad to CosmWasm Mastery

But why build a lending dApp, you ask? Well, get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into the real-world action of blockchain development! This seemingly advanced app is your launchpad into the exciting advanced world of CosmWasm development on MANTRA Chain.

Here's why this lending dApp is more than just taking a simple loan from a bank:

- **Hands-On Learning:** Building a lending dApp is the most hands-on and engaging way to grasp the core concepts of CosmWasm. You'll learn by doing, creating a working application from scratch.
- **Deployment and Interaction:** The thrill of coding doesn't end on your local machine. You'll deploy your dApp onto the MANTRA testnet and interact with it in a real blockchain environment. This hands-on experience will give you a taste of what it's like to bring your decentralized creations to life.

Building a lending dApp might seem like a small step, but it's a giant leap towards mastering the MANTRA Chain and unleashing your potential as a blockchain developer. So, let's get started on this exciting journey!
