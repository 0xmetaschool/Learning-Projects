# Set Up the Rock Paper Scissor Project on Move

Alright! We've set up our wallet and the Aptos-cli, and now it's time to start cooking up our rock-paper-scissors dApp. In this lesson, we'll guide you step-by-step on setting up your project so you can deploy your smart contract to the Aptos Network. Later, you'll learn how to interact with it using the front end. So let's get started!

## Tool time: Gathering your gear

Before we dive into the coding fun, we need to gather some essential tools. Think of it like prepping your ingredients before baking a cake – you can't make deliciousness without the right stuff!

1. **Node.js & npm (or yarn):** Node Js is the engine that powers your JavaScript code, even outside of a web browser. We need this for our frontend part.
    - **Download & install Node.js:** Head over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and grab the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The installer will also include npm (or you can choose to install yarn separately). Just follow the on-screen instructions if you need help deciding which one, npm is a great starting point.
    - **Verify success:** Open your terminal (or command prompt) and type the following commands:
        
        ```
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        
        (If you're using yarn, run `yarn -v` instead of `npm -v`)
        
    
    You should see version numbers for both Node.js and your package manager printed out. If you do, congrats! You've successfully installed Node.js and your package manager.
    
2. **Visual Studio code (VSCode):** This is our code editor of choice. It's a free, powerful tool that makes writing code a breeze. It's got a clean interface, tons of customization options, and a huge library of extensions to help you code like a pro.
    - **Download & install:** Grab it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the simple installation instructions.
    - Install [Move Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer). This extension provides essential language support for the Move programming language. Though it’s technically optional, we recommend installing it.
3. **Git:** Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. It's like a time machine for your code!
    - **Download & install:** Grab it from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the instructions.
4. **Git CLI:** It allows you to connect with git via the terminal, so let’s install it too. You can follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/cli/cli). 

Once you have installed the Git CLI, let me tell you how you can configure your terminal with it.
    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Run `gh --version` to ensure that you have installed the Git CLI successfully.
    3. Run `gh auth login --web` in your terminal and follow the steps given below:
        1. First, it will ask for your preferred protocol for Git operations. I chose HTTPS, you can choose any.
        2. Second, it will ask you to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, and type `Y`.
        3. Third, you will be able to see a code on your terminal. Copy it.
        4. Then, press Enter. It will open a window in your browser.
        5. Paste the code you copied and authorize your git. You might need to enter your GitHub password if you have yet to log in.

Awesome, you are all set!! Good job!

## Your rock-paper-scissors project

Instead of building everything from scratch, we have made it easy for you by providing a boilerplate code. This will help you to start right away~

In the same terminal where you configured your Git CLI, run the following command:

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/rock-paper-scissors-aptos-dapp.git --clone
cd rock-paper-scissors-aptos-dapp
```

This will clone the boilerplate code of your project onto your system and fork the repository to your Git account as well. And we will change the folder to this cloned repo.

Now run the following command in your terminal:

```
aptos init
```

1. When you run the above command, you’ll be prompted to choose a network. Type `testnet` and press Enter.
2. Next, you’ll be asked to provide the private key. Use the same private key you copied and saved from the previous lesson. Paste it into the terminal.

## That’s a wrap

Wow, we've been on a wild ride, haven't we? You've been absolutely stellar in crafting your project. Now, in our next lesson, get ready to dive headfirst into setting up our frontend part of dApp.
