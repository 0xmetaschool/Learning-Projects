# Creating the UI

Alrighty! So now that we have successfully set up our development environment, it‚Äôs time to switch things up a bit. Instead of providing you with a ready-made boilerplate, we're going to build it from the ground up together. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get started! üí™

## Frontend prep-work

In the Git repository you've forked, we'll set up our React project right in the root directory. Simply, run the `create-react-app` command in the root directory to set up a new React project with a standard development environment. Let's get started!

```
npx create-react-app interface --template typescript
```

Once you've set up the project, your React project structure should look like this:

## Adding wallet support

To play the game, users need to connect their wallet to the dApp. Once connected, they alone will be taken to the Game UI. So let‚Äôs add in wallet support for our dApp.

![01.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C4%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissor%20on%20Aptos%20Images/Lesson%205%20Creating%20the%20UI/01.gif?raw=true)

To get everything set up, just install `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` for managing wallet connections and `petra-plugin-wallet-adapter` for the wallet functionalities.

```
cd interface
npm install @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react petra-plugin-wallet-adapter --legacy-peer-deps
```

Locate your `index.tsx` file. Typically, it should be found at `interface\src\index.tsx`. Now we need to wrap the `App` component with the `AptosWalletAdapterProvider`. But first, let's prepare an array that contains instances of `PetraWallet` after we import it. Add the following lines to the file.

```tsx
// Import Petra-wallet adapter
import { PetraWallet } from "petra-plugin-wallet-adapter";

// Create wallet objects
const wallets = [
  new PetraWallet()
];
```

Finally, wrap the `App` component with the `AptosWalletAdapterProvider` component. Use the `plugins` prop to pass the `wallets` array and set `autoConnect` to `false`. Here‚Äôs how the final code should look :

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import {AptosWalletAdapterProvider} from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
import { PetraWallet } from "petra-plugin-wallet-adapter";

const wallets = [
  new PetraWallet()
];

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <AptosWalletAdapterProvider plugins={wallets} autoConnect={false}>
	    <App />
    </AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
reportWebVitals();
```

## Creating the wallet connection UI

First, you'll need to install some packages. We're using `styled-components` for styling and `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design` for the wallet connection UI. You can install them with these commands:

```
npm install styled-components @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design
npm install --save @types/styled-components
```

Now head out to `App.tsx` in the same `*src`* folder. To get started import the `WalletSelector` component from `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design` package and it‚Äôs CSS file.

```tsx
import { WalletSelector } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design";
import "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design/dist/index.css";
```

We will be also taking advantage of the `useWallet` hook. This hook provides a simple way to access the wallet's connection status and related information. Specifically, it gives us access to:

- `connected`: A Boolean value indicating whether the wallet is connected.
- `account`: The account details of the connected wallet.
- `signAndSubmitTransaction`: A function to sign and submit transactions using the connected wallet.

By using this hook, we can easily determine if a wallet is connected and display an appropriate message to the user. The rest will come in handy soon in the next lessons.

Finally, we render our component. The `WalletWrapper` contains the `WalletSelector`, which is a ready-made UI component for connecting the wallet. Below that, we conditionally render a message based on whether the wallet is connected. If it's connected, we show "Wallet is connected"; if not, we prompt the user to connect their wallet.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { WalletSelector } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design";
import { useWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
import styled from "styled-components";
import "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design/dist/index.css";

const WindowWrapper = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
`;

const WalletWrapper = styled.div`
  position: absolute;
  right: 10px;
  top: 10px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
`;

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const { connected } = useWallet();

  return (
    <WindowWrapper>
      <WalletWrapper>
        <WalletSelector />
      </WalletWrapper>
      {connected ? (
        <h1>Wallet is connected</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Please connect your wallet to continue</h1>
      )}
    </WindowWrapper>
  );
};

export default App;

```

And that's it! This simple setup lets users connect their wallet and see an immediate indication of the connection status. It's a neat and straightforward way to get started with wallet integration in your React app.

## First launch

Launch the react app by running the following command : 

```
npm start
```

Once the App spins up in the browser you can test whether the Wallet connection works as intended by clicking on the *Connect Wallet* and selecting Petra Wallet in the popup window. You should be able to see the ‚ÄúWallet is Connected‚Äù message in your App.

## That‚Äôs a wrap

And that's it! This simple setup lets users connect their wallet and see an immediate indication of the connection status. It's a neat and straightforward way to get started with wallet integration in your React app. We‚Äôll see how to fetch and submit data to the Aptos Blockchain in the upcoming lessons.
