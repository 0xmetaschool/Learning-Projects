# Quick Overview of Aptos world

Hey there! Welcome back! Let’s onboard our journey of building the rock-paper-scissors game. But first, let’s revise a few concepts from our previous courses. No time for waiting, let’s just jump right into it.

## Move it or lose it: Why Move?

Born from Facebook's Diem project and based on the Rust programming language, Move is ideal for building dApps. Aptos Labs adopted and optimized Move for their blockchain, focusing on dialects and functionalities specific to the Aptos environment. Despite these optimizations, Aptos Move remains highly similar to core Move (around 70-80%), making the transition smooth for existing Move developers.

We dive into the fascinating world of Move—your ticket to building secure, reliable, and awesome smart contracts! Move prioritizes safety with static typing and a resource-oriented approach, ensuring memory safety and preventing common vulnerabilities. It treats digital assets as special resource types, allowing strict control over ownership and transfer on the blockchain. Compiling to bytecode for direct execution by the blockchain enhances efficiency and security. Additionally, Move’s modular design promotes code reusability and better organization for complex smart contracts.

## What was the need for Move?

In one word: Security. Since 2020, the web3 ecosystem has lost nearly $8 billion to hacks and attacks. Move is designed to prevent common security flaws like reentrancy attacks and integer overflows, prevalent in other smart contract languages. When building decentralized apps (dApps), security and reliability are crucial. Aptos Move helps prevent these issues through key features such as resource-centric design, enforced scarcity, granular access control, and formal verification, ensuring that dApps are secure and reliable by design.

## Aptos asset standard

Fungible tokens (FTs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the cornerstone of the web3 space, each serving unique purposes. FTs are identical and interchangeable tokens akin to dollar bills or arcade tokens, where each token holds the same value and properties. In contrast, NFTs are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain, each one distinct and irreplaceable, making them ideal for representing collectibles, artworks, and even real-world items.

The Aptos blockchain supports creating both FTs and NFTs through its defined standards. The Aptos Fungible Asset Standard is used for regular tokens, tokenized real-world assets, and in-game assets. The Aptos Digital Asset Standard is an advanced NFT standard that allows organizing NFTs into collections and modifying, transferring, or burning them through custom smart contracts. These standards leverage Move's object model, facilitating easier development and enabling developers to add custom properties to their tokens, thereby speeding up app development and ensuring seamless integration and secure transactions within the Aptos ecosystem.

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we covered how Move is optimized by Aptos Labs for their blockchain, retaining similarities to core Move for ease of use. It prioritizes security with features like static typing, resource-oriented design, and bytecode compilation. Aptos also supports fungible and non-fungible tokens through robust standards, ensuring seamless integration and secure transactions.
