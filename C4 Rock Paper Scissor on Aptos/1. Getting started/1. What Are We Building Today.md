# What Are We Building Today

GM everyone! ☀️ We’re super excited to kick off the fourth, yes fourthhh course in our detailed series on Aptos for developers here on Metaschool. First things first, let’s give you a big round of applause for completing the THREE courses on Metaschool Woohoo! 🎉

Pro move: Savvy blockchain enthusiasts know the value of following project repos on [GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs). It's a great way to stay ahead of the curve and potentially catch some interesting opportunities like airdrop maybe!

We know that Aptos is a layer-1 blockchain boasting over 3.9 million monthly active users and more than 983 million transactions to date. With over 170 projects spanning various sectors such as DeFi, NFT tooling, gaming, wallets, stablecoins, and marketplaces, Aptos is a vibrant ecosystem. We are excited to assist you in launching another of your projects on the Aptos platform.

We’ve delved into the Aptos blockchain and mastered its programming language basics. We’ve even built a calculator and a fungible token on Aptos! Now, it's time to take things to the next level with an exhilarating challenge. Get ready to unleash your creativity and skills as we dive into developing an advanced project: a thrilling game of Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Just for your excitement, I have added a GIF that shows how we will interact with our token. But [here’s the vercel link](https://rock-paper-scissors-nzp4.vercel.app/) too so you can interact live with the dApp.

But why build a game contract, you ask? Buckle up, because here's why:

- **Hands-on learning:** Writing a contract is an engaging and practical way to grasp Aptos blockchain concepts.
- **Deployment and interaction:** The excitement doesn't stop at coding! You'll deploy your contract onto Aptos, interact with it on the Explorer, and see your code come to life in a decentralized environment.

## Features of the game contract

This course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to build the following functionalities of a rock-paper-scissors game contract on Aptos Move:

- **Initialization of game state**: It manages the initialization of the game for a user, setting up a structure if it doesn't already exist for the user.
- **Random computer selection**: It utilizes the Aptos `randomness` module to generate a random number between 0 and 2, corresponding to "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
- **Gameplay execution**: It manages the user's ability to play by providing their selection (rock, paper, or scissors). It compares the user's selection against the computer's random selection to determine the outcome (Win, Lose, Draw).
- **Outcome storage:** The outcome is stored for each game.
- **Reusability**: The game can be played multiple times by the same user, updating the result each time a new duel is initiated.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Do a quick run-through of what we have covered so far.
2. Get your tools and workspace ready for development.
3. Build the foundations of the contract.
4. Add functionalities for setting up the game and game state management.
5. Deploy and Interact with the contract on Aptos Testnet Explorer.
6. Add frontend and interact with the game in real time.

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for  Web3 developers who wish to dive deeper into the Aptos world and have completed our first three (beginner) courses on Aptos. You should have basic programming knowledge as it will help you have a quick start to this course but if not, we are here for you!

## What will you be getting out of this course?

As a developer, you will be getting the following outcomes when you complete this course:

1. Utilize Move to build on Aptos
2. Build Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Contract on Aptos
3. Claim your NFT upon course completion

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me, you will get a special NFT that will unlock many more opportunities on the Metaschool platform. Here is what the NFT looks like.
