# Setting Up the Game UI

Welcome! You did awesome in the coding time. Let's dive into the frontend part and implement our rock-paper-scissors game. Time for some action~ So why wait, let’s go~

## Sending data over to the chain

Now that we have spun up the function for creating the game, Let’s make our React App able to invoke this function so that we can go in and implement the duel logic later.

Remember the `useWallet()` Hook from the UI lesson? To interact with the Aptos Blockchain, we will need to sign and send transactions to the blockchain network for processing and confirmation. That’s where the `signAndSubmitTransaction` function is provided by the `useWallet()` Hook. 

```tsx
const { account, connected, signAndSubmitTransaction } = useWallet();
```

Next, we need the `InputTransactionData` to define the structure of transaction data used to interact with blockchain smart contracts, specifying functions and arguments for execution. let’s get it imported from `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package.

```tsx
import {
  InputTransactionData,
  useWallet,
} from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
```

We’ve already created an empty function called `toggleActiveState` that will kick in when you hit "Start Game". Let’s use `InputTransactionData` to create a payload—it's like a little package of data that tells the blockchain what to do and what arguments to use (which are stored as an array).

```tsx
  const toggleActiveState = async () => {
	    const payload: InputTransactionData = {
        data: {
          function: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::createGame`,
          functionArguments: [],
        },
      };
  };
```

This payload includes important stuff like the module address (`moduleAddress`) and module name (`moduleName`). These details are crucial because they pinpoint exactly which function should run on the blockchain. To keep things tidy and flexible, we'll store these values in an `.env` file as environment variables. This makes it easy to tweak them as needed and keeps our setup clean and organized.

Now we can finally use the `signAndSubmitTransaction` function to execute the function. Let’s also add in some edge case checks and initialize our state variables.

```tsx
const toggleActiveState = async () => {
    setIsActive(!isActive);
    if (!account) return;
    if (!isActive) {
      console.log("Toggling active state: " + isActive);
      const payload: InputTransactionData = {
        data: {
          function: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::createGame`,
          functionArguments: [],
        },
      };
      const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction(payload);
      console.log(response);
    }
    setInput("");
    setResult("");
    setComputerSelection("");
  };
```

## Let’s test it out

Launch the react app by running the following command : 

```powershell
npm start
```

Once the App spins up again in your browser, connect your wallet and click on the Start game button to initialize the game.

Even though we can’t play the game yet, you can use the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=testnet) to view the new resource created against your address for our Game.

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `rock-paper-scissors-aptos-dapp` folder.

As always, remember to push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 

```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## That’s a wrap

Now, with our React app set up to interact with the blockchain, we've tackled how to trigger functions using `signAndSubmitTransaction`, ensuring our game functions as intended. Next, we'll focus on implementing the game logic itself, ensuring our dApp handles player choices and determines the winner seamlessly.

Feeling confident? Great! Let's keep pushing forward and bring our rock-paper-scissors game to life. Happy coding!
