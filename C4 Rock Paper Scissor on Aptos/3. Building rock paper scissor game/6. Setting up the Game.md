# Setting Up the Game

Welcome! Youâ€™re doing great in setting up all the essentials. Now itâ€™s coding time. Let's dive deeper into the constants, and variables, and create a game function. These are crucial for our dApp to function correctly and efficiently. 

Time to finally implement our rock-paper-scissors game. So why wait, letâ€™s go~

## Quick checkout

First, letâ€™s quickly swap out our boilerplate with the corresponding front end for these functionalities. 

```
git checkout origin/boilerplate_02
```

Navigate to the `sources/RockPaperScissors.move` file and letâ€™s go through the code. 

Hereâ€™s the complete code mentioned in `sources/RockPaperScissors.move` file:

```tsx
module metaschool::RockPaperScissors_01 {
    use std::string::{String,utf8};
    use std::signer;

    struct DuelResult has key
    {
        computer_selection: String,
        duel_result: String
    }

    public entry fun createGame(account: &signer)acquires DuelResult { 
        if (exists<DuelResult>(signer::address_of(account))){
            let result = borrow_global_mut<DuelResult>(signer::address_of(account));
            result.computer_selection = utf8(b"New Game Created");  
            result.duel_result = utf8(b"Game not yet played");
        }
        else {
            let result = DuelResult { computer_selection: utf8(b"New Game Created") , duel_result:utf8(b"Game not yet played")};
            move_to(account, result);
        }
    }
}
```

## Code explanation

The code explanation is:

```tsx
module metaschool::RockPaperScissors_01 {
```

- This line defines a new Move module named `RockPaperScissors_01` within the `metaschool` package.

```tsx
    use std::string::{String,utf8};
    use std::signer;
```

- These lines import the `String` and `utf8` utilities from the standard library for handling strings, and the `signer` module for handling account signers.

```tsx
    struct DuelResult has key
    {
        computer_selection: String,
        duel_result: String
    }
```

- This block defines a struct named `DuelResult` with two string fields: `computer_selection` and `duel_result`. The `has key` attribute indicates that instances of this struct can be stored in the global storage associated with a specific address.

```tsx
    public entry fun createGame(account: &signer) acquires DuelResult {
```

- This line defines a public entry function named `createGame` that takes a reference to a `signer` type account as a parameter. The `acquires DuelResult` clause indicates that this function will access and modify `DuelResult` resources in the global storage.

```tsx
        if (exists<DuelResult>(signer::address_of(account))){
```

- This line checks if a `DuelResult` resource already exists at the address of the given account.

```tsx
            let result = borrow_global_mut<DuelResult>(signer::address_of(account));
```

- If a `DuelResult` resource exists, this line borrows it mutably from the global storage.

```tsx
            result.computer_selection = utf8(b"New Game Created");
            result.duel_result = utf8(b"Game not yet played");
```

- These lines set the `computer_selection` field to "New Game Created" and the `duel_result` field to "Game not yet played" in the borrowed `DuelResult` resource.

```tsx
        }
        else {
            let result = DuelResult { computer_selection: utf8(b"New Game Created"), duel_result: utf8(b"Game not yet played")};
            move_to(account, result);
        }
    }
}
```

- This line starts an `else` block that runs if a `DuelResult` resource does not already exist at the account's address.
- This line creates a new `DuelResult` instance with the fields `computer_selection` and `duel_result` set to "New Game Created" and "Game not yet played", respectively.
- This line moves the new `DuelResult` instance to the global storage at the address of the given account.

## Deploy your dApp

Letâ€™s go ahead and deploy the contract using the CLI. 

### Update `Move.toml`

First things first, we need to add our wallet address. So go to the `Move.toml` and update `Replace_with_your_wallet_address_ðŸ”‘`Â with your wallet address.

![aptos-c4-l6.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C4%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissor%20on%20Aptos%20Images/Lesson%206%20Setting%20up%20the%20Game/aptos-c4-l6.webp?raw=true)

### Deploy the code

Now open a terminal in the `rock-paper-scissors-aptos-dapp` folder and run the following command:

```
aptos move compile
```

The command will essentially compile our code and if the compilation is successful that means our code is mostly error-free and ready to be pushed to a network. The output will look like this:

![aptos-c4-l6 (1).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C4%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissor%20on%20Aptos%20Images/Lesson%206%20Setting%20up%20the%20Game/aptos-c4-l6_(1).webp?raw=true)

### Publish the contract

The following command will publish our code to the Aptos testnet. While running the command, it will prompt you regarding the transaction fee payment, just add a â€˜yesâ€™ there.

```
aptos move publish
```

And once that is done, the CLI will automatically publish the code to the Aptos testnet. The output will look like this:

![aptos-c4-l6 (2).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/C4%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissor%20on%20Aptos%20Images/Lesson%206%20Setting%20up%20the%20Game/aptos-c4-l6_(2).webp?raw=true)

We are done with the contract part. Letâ€™s explore how to use it in the frontend in the next lesson.

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Well, itâ€™s a wrap! You did great in understanding the initial structure of our code. We compiled and published that code too. Get ready for the next lesson where we will implement the frontend logic.
