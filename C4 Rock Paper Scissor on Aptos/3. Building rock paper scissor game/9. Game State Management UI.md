# Game State Management UI

Hey hero! Welcome back! So far we have implemented the logic and deployed it too. Now it’s time to add a complete frontend so we can successfully interact with our dApp. Can’t wait? Me too! So let’s dive right into it!

## Fetching data from the chain

Just like we called the `createGame` function in our React app, we can use the same steps to call the `duel` function when triggered by the action buttons.

```tsx
const handleOperationClick = async (operation: string) => {
    setResult("");
    setComputerSelection("");
    if (
      operation === "Rock" ||
      operation === "Paper" ||
      operation === "Scissors"
    ) {
      setInput(` ${operation} `);
      try {
        if (!account) return;
        setTransactionInProgress(true);
        const payload: InputTransactionData = {
          data: {
            function: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::duel`,
            functionArguments: [operation],
          },
        };
        const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction(payload);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } finally {
        setTransactionInProgress(false);
      }
    } else {
      setInput(` ${operation} `);
    }
  };
```

But what about when we need to fetch data from the Aptos blockchain? No worries! We can use the [Aptos TypeScript SDK](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/ts-sdk). This handy SDK has all the classes and functions we need to easily interact with and query the Aptos chain. Follow the steps below to integrate it into your React App.

Stop the local server if it’s already running and then install the SDK in the interface directory using :

```
npm install @aptos-labs/ts-sdk
```

Import the `Aptos` and `AptosConfig` class in your `App.tsx` along with `Network`.

```tsx
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
```

By default, `Aptos` will interact with the `devnet` network, to set it up with the Testnet, we will use the `AptosConfig` class that we just imported. Let’s then go in and create an instance of Aptos class as well.

```tsx
const aptosConfig = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET });
const client = new Aptos(aptosConfig);
```

We can now use the instance of Aptos Class we named `client` and fetch resources using the `getAccountResource` function. This function takes an object as a parameter with the *account address* and *resource type* as its fields.

```tsx
const resultData = await client.getAccountResource({
  accountAddress: account?.address,
  resourceType: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::DuelResult`,
});
```

We can then update our state variable for the result by typecasting the `resultData` to String. The final function will look this the following.

```tsx
  const handleOperationClick = async (operation: string) => {
    setResult("");
    setComputerSelection("");
    if (
      operation === "Rock" ||
      operation === "Paper" ||
      operation === "Scissors"
    ) {
      setInput(` ${operation} `);
      try {
        if (!account) return;
        setTransactionInProgress(true);
        const payload: InputTransactionData = {
          data: {
            function: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::duel`,
            functionArguments: [operation],
          },
        };
        const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction(payload);
        const resultData = await client.getAccountResource({
          accountAddress: account?.address,
          resourceType: `${moduleAddress}::${moduleName}::DuelResult`,
        });
        console.log(resultData);
        setResult(resultData.duel_result.toString());
        setComputerSelection(resultData.computer_selection.toString());
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      } finally {
        setTransactionInProgress(false);
      }
    } else {
      setInput(` ${operation} `);
    }
  };
```

## Let’s test it out

Launch the react app by running the following command : 

```
npm start
```

Once the app reloads in your browser, connect your wallet and hit the "Start Game" button to get started. Make your move in the rock-paper-scissors game, and after you approve the transaction, the result and the computer's choice will be fetched from the Aptos blockchain.

## Pushing it to Git

Make sure you are in `rock-paper-scissors-aptos-dapp` folder.

As always, remember to push your code to your GitHub repository using the following commands. 

```
git add .
git commit -m "code update"
git push
```

## That’s a wrap

Congratulations! You've successfully built and deployed a complete rock-paper-scissors game on the Aptos blockchain. Throughout our lessons, we explored how to leverage the on-chain randomness provided by Aptos to ensure fair play and unpredictability in our game. We also saw how to use the Aptos TypeScript SDK to interact with the blockchain seamlessly from our React app. Keep experimenting and exploring the capabilities of Aptos and the TypeScript SDK in your future projects.
