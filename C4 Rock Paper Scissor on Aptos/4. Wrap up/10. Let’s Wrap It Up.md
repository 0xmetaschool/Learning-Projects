# Let’s Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned and how it can empower you in the world of blockchain development.

## What we covered

- **Introduction:** Got an overview of what we will build and the course structure.
- **Overview of Aptos world:** We revised why Aptos, Move, and its features are bringing change to the web3 world.
- **Aptos SDK:** We understood the Aptos SDK support for the frontend part and what features it has for us and how can we utilize them to create our dApp.
- **Getting started with development:** Learnt how to set up our development environment using the Aptos CLI. We installed the necessary tools and created a wallet.
- **Create, deploy, and interact with dApp:** We wrote the contract for our dApp and utilized the randomness feature of Aptos. We deployed it to frontend and interacted with it.

Yes, we did this all! Cheers~
