# Let’s Implement the Basics

Welcome back, you awesome person! We are all set for writing code so in this lesson, we will implement the basic structure of the frontend to help you understand the structure of the code.

## Start coding

Navigate to `src/App.js` and remove the existing code as we will be writing our own.

Let’s first import the libraries and some of the assets we imported:

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import useSound from 'use-sound';
import Web3 from "web3";
import HogwartsNFT from "./artifacts/HogwartsNFT.json"; 
import RandomHouseAssignment from "./artifacts/RandomHouseAssignment.json"; 
import HogwartsLogo from "./assets/hogwarts_logo.png"; // import the image
import "./App.css";
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import HPLoader from "./loaders/hpLoader.json"

//import audio
import gryffindorSound from "./sounds/gryffindor.mp3";
import hufflepuffSound from "./sounds/hufflepuff.mp3";
import ravenclawSound from "./sounds/ravenclaw.mp3";
import slytherinSound from "./sounds/slytherin.mp3";
import thinkingSound from "./sounds/thinking.mp3"; 
import bgSound from "./sounds/bg_music.mp3";
```

These are basic assets like the default react libraries along with `useSound` which we will be using later in the code and lastly the `web3` library to interact with the blockchain.

After this let’s initialize the web3 library using the following line.

```
const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
```

Now, let’s get started with the main `App()` function:

```
function App(){
//rest of the code will go here
}

return (
    //Return code goes here
);
}

export default App;
```

Let’s first create the App states, each of these states will manage the state of different functionality of the app. Just add the following code to `App()` function:

```
  const [account, setAccount] = useState("");
  const [hogwartsContract, setHogwartsContract] = useState(null);
  const [randomHouseContract, setRandomHouseContract] = useState(null);  
  const [house, setHouse] = useState("");
  const [house_slogan, sethouseSlogan] = useState("");
  const [minted, setMinted] = useState(false);
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false); 
  const [checkMintedSuccess, setCheckMintSuccess] = useState(0);
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(30);
  const [displayCounter, setDisplayCounter] = useState(false);
  const [started, setStarted] = useState(false);
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState("");
  const [isUserNameSubmitted, setIsUserNameSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const [responseLoading, setResponseLoading] = useState(false);
```

Don’t worry!! You will learn about these states as we move forward with the code.

Next, let’s create two `const` which will store a default and dynamic loading message which will be used when the loading state is true:

```
const defaultLoadingMessage = "Ah, right then... hmm... right";
const dynamicLoadingMessage = `Ahh seems difficult, let me think harder, wait for ${counter}`;
```

Here, the counter is also a state which starts counting backwards from 60.

Now, lastly let’s implement the return statement:

```
return (
      <div className="App">
	       <img className="Hogwarts-logo" src={HogwartsLogo} alt="Hogwarts Logo" />
        <h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>
			</div>
);
}
```

Here, we simply made a basic layout for our main page of the application. We made `div`, imported the image using `HogwartsLogo` that we imported at the start of the code and then added the `h1` heading.

## Basic structure

Here is how your basic structure will look like now:

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import useSound from 'use-sound';
import Web3 from "web3";
import HogwartsNFT from "./artifacts/HogwartsNFT.json"; 
import RandomHouseAssignment from "./artifacts/RandomHouseAssignment.json"; 
import HogwartsLogo from "./assets/hogwarts_logo.png"; 
import "./App.css";
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import HPLoader from "./loaders/hpLoader.json"

//import audio
import gryffindorSound from "./sounds/gryffindor.mp3";
import hufflepuffSound from "./sounds/hufflepuff.mp3";
import ravenclawSound from "./sounds/ravenclaw.mp3";
import slytherinSound from "./sounds/slytherin.mp3";
import thinkingSound from "./sounds/thinking.mp3"; 
import bgSound from "./sounds/bg_music.mp3";

const web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);

function App() {
  const [account, setAccount] = useState("");
  const [hogwartsContract, setHogwartsContract] = useState(null);
  const [randomHouseContract, setRandomHouseContract] = useState(null);  
  const [house, setHouse] = useState("");
  const [house_slogan, sethouseSlogan] = useState("");
  const [minted, setMinted] = useState(false);
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false); 
  const [checkMintedSuccess, setCheckMintSuccess] = useState(0);
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(60);
  const [displayCounter, setDisplayCounter] = useState(false);
  const [started, setStarted] = useState(false);
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState("");
  const [isUserNameSubmitted, setIsUserNameSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const [responseLoading, setResponseLoading] = useState(false);

  const defaultLoadingMessage = "Ah, right then... hmm... right";
  const dynamicLoadingMessage = `Ahh seems difficult, let me think harder, wait for ${counter}`;

	return (
      <div className="App">
	       <img className="Hogwarts-logo" src={HogwartsLogo} alt="Hogwarts Logo" />
        <h1>Welcome to Hogwarts</h1>
			</div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we learned about the basic structure of the frontend and initialized the necessary libraries and assets. We also created the App states and implemented the return statement. This sets us up for further implementation of the functionality of the app.
