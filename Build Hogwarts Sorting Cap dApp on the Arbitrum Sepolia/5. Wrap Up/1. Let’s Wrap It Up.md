# 🎉 Let’s Wrap It Up!

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! 🎉 It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Get ready for a quick recap that will leave you feeling accomplished and ready to conquer the world! 

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Development Environment

You set up the development environment and installed all the necessary dependencies. You learned how to:

- ✅ set up the testnet environment
- ✅ connect your Metamask wallet
- ✅ fetch fake ETH and Link from Chainlink Faucet
- ✅ set Remix project
- ✅ set up Chainlink

## ✍️ Writing Smart Contracts

You wrote `HogwartsNFT.sol` that allows the owner to mint non-fungible tokens representing the four Hogwarts houses. And you also wrote `RandomHouseAssignment.sol` to randomly assign Hogwarts houses to users. You used Chainlink's VRF service to generate random numbers, and then minted an NFT for the user with the randomly assigned house.

## ✍️ Writing Smart Contracts

You wrote the deploy scripts and update the necessary files to compile the contracts.

## 🖥️ Adding the Frontend

You added frontend to your dApp, learned to integrate the frontend with the backend (smart contracts) and interacted with it.
