# Set Up Your Project

Greetings folks! Let‚Äôs dive right into setting up our project. Let‚Äôs go!!

## What is a development environment?

You now need a super cool environment to run your code in and you need to set it up!

For this tutorial, you will use MetaMask wallet, Polygon faucet, PolygonScan API, Chainlink, and Hardhat, and IDE like Visual Studio for compiling and deploying your code. Don‚Äôt worry, setting them up is easy and you will do it in no time!

## MetaMask

If you do not have MetaMask extension, you can install in your browser using [Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

### Setting up the testnet environment

Now we need to set the testnet network so we can deploy our dapp on it. Complete the following steps to set it up:

- Head over to [https://metaschool.so/rpc/amoy](https://metaschool.so/rpc/amoy).
- Click on first ‚ÄúAdd to Metamask‚Äù button.

- Click on ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù and then ‚ÄúSwitch network‚Äù.

You will be successfully connected to Amoy network. See in the following gif how I did it:

### Get some fake MATIC $$ ü§ë

Now its time to get some money!

- Copy your account address from MetaMask.
- Head over to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
- Connect your discord for verification
- Select Polygon PoS(Amoy) as the network
- Make sure MATIC is selected as the token
- Paste your wallet address
- Click on ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù
- You will receive some fake MATIC

## Set Hardhat project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```
mkdir hogwarts-dapp
cd hogwarts-dapp
npm install --save-dev hardhat --force
```

Initialize a new Hardhat project using the following command:

```
npx hardhat init
```

You will see an output like shown below. Select Javascript project and hit Enter for all other options:

Install all dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install --force
npm install hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan dotenv ethers --force
```

Your project directory now looks like this:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we have got some fake MATICs and set up our Hardhat project and installed necessary dependencies. Next, we will learn to secure necessary data.
