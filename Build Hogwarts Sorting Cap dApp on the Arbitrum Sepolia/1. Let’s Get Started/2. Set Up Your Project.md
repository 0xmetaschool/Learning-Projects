# 🚀 Set Up Your Project 

Ahoy, mateys! 🏴‍☠️ Ready to set sail on your Web3 adventure? Let's get your project up and running in no time. Grab your favorite snack, and let’s dive in!

## ⚙️ Prerequisites 

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Your code’s best friend! 💻
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - We’re using `v20.18.0`. Check yours with:
  ```sh
  node --version
  ```
- [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) - Your gateway to the blockchain! 🦊

## 🌍 Setting Up the Testnet 

We need to connect to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet to deploy our smart contract. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/421614).
2. Click on **“Add to MetaMask”**.

3. Click **“Approve”** and then **“Switch network”**.

Boom! You’re now connected to Arbitrum Sepolia. 🎉 Check out the GIF below for reference:

### Get Some Test ETH 💰

Now it’s time to fund your wallet with some test ETH! Just like Nami, we love stacking coins. 😉

1. Copy your MetaMask wallet address.
2. Go to [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
3. Connect your Metamask wallet to chainlink website.
4. Paste your wallet address.

5. Click **“Get Tokens”**.
6. Receive **0.5 ETH + 25 LINK** and flex on your friends! 💎

> **Troubleshooting:** If you don’t get ETH, sign up or log in to Alchemy and try again.

## 🛠️ Set Up the Remix Project 

Now, let’s get our development environment ready with **Remix**, a browser-based IDE that makes smart contract development easy. 

### Steps to Set Up Remix:

1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser.
2. Click on **File Explorers** 📁 and create a new workspace.
3. Inside your workspace, create a new file, e.g., `OnePieceDapp.sol`.
4. Start writing your **Solidity** smart contract! 🚀


Just like **Sunny Go** is always ready to take our crew anywhere, our Remix setup is ready to launch us into Web3! 🌊

## 🎯 Wrap Up 

In this lesson, we:

✅ Connected to the **Arbitrum Sepolia** testnet 🌐  
✅ Got **free test ETH** 💸  
✅ Set up **Remix** for writing and deploying smart contracts ✨

Next up, we’ll start coding our smart contract and take our Web3 journey to the next level! See you in the next lesson, future blockchain pirate! 🏴‍☠️
