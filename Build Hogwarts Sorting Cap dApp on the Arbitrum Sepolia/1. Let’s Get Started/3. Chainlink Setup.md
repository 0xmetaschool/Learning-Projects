# ðŸ”— Integrating Chainlink VRF on Arbitrum Sepolia

Welcome to this exciting lesson on integrating **Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** into your smart contract on **Arbitrum Sepolia**. By the end of this module, you will have a fully functional randomness setup, crucial for fair draws, lotteries, and unpredictable outcomes in blockchain applications. Let's dive in!

## ðŸ›  Step 1: Connecting Your Wallet & Retrieving VRF Details

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open [Chainlink VRF](https://vrf.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia) in your browser.
2. Click **Connect Wallet** and authorize your **MetaMask** connection.
3. Locate and copy the VRF Coordinator Address. We'll use this in the upcoming lesson steps, so make sure to note it down.

4. Similarly, copy the Key Hash and keep it handy. This will be required in the later steps of the lesson.

## ðŸ”‘ Step 2: Creating & Managing Your Subscription

Chainlink VRF requires a subscription to function. Let's create one!

1. Click **Create Subscription** and follow the prompts:
   - Click **Create Subscription**.
   
     ![Create Subscription](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/one-piece-dapp/Secure%20Your%20Data/chainlink-3.webp?raw=true)
   
   - Sign and confirm the transaction.

2. Navigate to **Home > My Subscriptions**. Find your newly created subscription and copy the **Subscription ID**.

3. Update your `.env` file by replacing `<your-chainlink-vrf-subscription-id>` with the copied ID.

## ðŸ’° Step 3: Funding Your Subscription

Before making VRF requests, we need to **fund the subscription**. Here's how:

1. Click **Action > Fund Subscription**.

2. Click **Visit the Chainlink Arbitrum Sepolia Faucet** and request **25 test LINK**.

3. Return to **Subscription Page**, enter **15 LINK** in **Add Funds**, and click **Confirm**.

## ðŸŽ‰ Wrap-up & Next Steps

Fantastic work! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully set up **Chainlink VRF** and funded your subscription. This ensures that your smart contract can now request **random numbers in a secure and verifiable way**.

In the next lesson, we'll **integrate Chainlink VRF into a Solidity smart contract** to generate truly random numbers on-chain. Get ready for some hands-on coding action!

ðŸš€ **See you in the next lesson!**
