# 🧙‍♂️ What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone ☀️ We are super hyped to bring you this course where you'll build a Solidity project that takes your Web3 skills to the next level. 

## So, what are we building? 🤔

We're crafting our very own **Hogwarts Sorting Hat dApp**! 🎩✨ Inspired by the legendary Harry Potter concept, this dApp will magically sort you (and your friends) into your respective Hogwarts houses. 

This project is a fantastic way to sharpen your Solidity skills while having fun. By the end, you'll have built and deployed a functional dApp in the Web3 ecosystem!

Curious to see how it works? Try out the live version [here](https://jatin192-hogwarts-dapp-beta.vercel.app/). We'll be using the **Arbitrum Sepolia** testnet to power our dApp.
