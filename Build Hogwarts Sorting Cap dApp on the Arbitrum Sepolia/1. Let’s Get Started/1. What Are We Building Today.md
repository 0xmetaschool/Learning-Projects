# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ☀️ We are very excited to bring the course where you will build a project in Solidity to help you become a Solidity and dApp creation master.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own Hogwarts Sorting Hat dApp. Yes, inspired by the Harry Potter concept, we will sort you and your friends to their respective houses. This project is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to build a dApp in the web3 ecosystem.


Let’s look at how you will be interacting with the dApp by the end of the course. You can also try using it live [here](https://hogwarts-app.vercel.app/). We will be using Polygon Mumbai network to connect to the app. In case you are going to try out the demo application.

Why Hogwarts Sorting dApp? You can unlock your wizardry in Solidity and master web3 dApp development with our Hogwarts Sorting dApp course. You will learn the magic behind smart contracts while creating a fun and interactive project, ensuring you not only ace Solidity but also become a wizard in the world of decentralized applications.

Not only this, Solidity is most popular language of web3 and in demand too! There are ~200,000 Solidity developers and their maximum yearly salary is $250k. On average, 128 new jobs for Solidity developers are posted every month.

## Course overview

We will:

1. Set up basic project using Hardhat
2. Learn how to code Hogwarts randomness in Solidity
3. Deploy the smart contracts on Polygon Amoy Testnet
4. Set up React frontend and integrate it with the Solidity smart contract (backend)
5. Deploy the final dApp and interact with it

- **Keep your momentum going! In 3rd to 11th lesson, we’ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can’t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for intermediate web3 developers who want to up skill their dApp building and Solidity command. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), Solidity Programming language, and frontend technologies because in this course we will focus more on building and deploying our dApp. Don’t worry! If you don’t know the basics we got you covered, you can always reach out to us for any help.

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your MetaMask if you still hasn’t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.
