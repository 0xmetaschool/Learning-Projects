# A Quick Tour of Web3Auth

To bring our Web3 X app to life, we need a way to recognize unique users and their identities. Traditionally, apps handle this by creating user accounts. But in the Web3 world, we take a smarter and safer approach—associating accounts instead of managing them directly.

🤔 Ever heard of **Single Sign-On (SSO)?** SSO makes user authentication smoother and more secure. Since we're building a **X-inspired Web3 app**, it only makes sense to let users log in with X itself!

This is where **Web3Auth** comes in. It’s a powerful authentication library that allows seamless **social logins** (X, Google, etc.) while integrating smoothly with blockchain wallets.

But wait—Web3Auth doesn’t just stop at login! It:

✅ Reduces onboarding time to seconds

✅ Eliminates the hassle of seed phrases

✅ Offers **non-custodial multi-factor authentication**

✅ Supports third-party APIs like **Fiat-to-Crypto conversion**

### Creating a Torus Wallet

Before we dive into Web3Auth, we first need a **Torus Wallet**. This wallet acts as your gateway to the Web3 world, allowing you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain without worrying about complex key management.

Unlike **MetaMask or Trust Wallet**, **Torus Wallet** lets you log in using social accounts—so no more stressing over lost private keys or seed phrases!

### Setting Up Your Torus Wallet 🌐

1️⃣ Go to [**app.tor.us**](https://app.tor.us/)

2️⃣ Sign up with your preferred social login (**X, Google, etc.**)

3️⃣ Boom! 🚀 Your **Torus Wallet** is ready!

You’ll now see your **public wallet address** in the **top-right corner** of your wallet dashboard. It will look something like this:

📌 Example: `0x68a25CAf469eC43DC564A59Dba2cC842Bf9779D5`

Your **public address** is safe to share! You can use it to:

💰 Buy, trade, and store **Ethereum-based tokens & NFTs**

🔑 Log in to **Web3 platforms** like OpenSea

### Switching to Sepolia Testnet

We’re not deploying our contract on the **Ethereum Mainnet** just yet (gas fees, ouch! 💸). Instead, we’ll use **Sepolia Testnet**—a sandbox network for testing smart contracts without real ETH costs.

### How to Switch Your Torus Wallet to Sepolia:

1️⃣ Open your **Torus Wallet**

2️⃣ Navigate to **Settings**

3️⃣ Select **Sepolia Test Network**

⚡ Now, your wallet is connected to a safe **Ethereum test environment**!

### Retrieving Your Private Torus Wallet Key 🔐

Your **private key** is your **master access** to your wallet. You can find it under:

📌 **Settings → Private Key**

![image.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20your%20own%20web3%20X%20dApp%20with%20Solidity/3.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20work%20on%20the%20backend%20now/2.%20A%20Quick%20Tour%20of%20Web3Auth/image%203.webp?raw=true)

🚨 **IMPORTANT:** NEVER share your private key with anyone. EVER.

🔴 **DO NOT:**

❌ Upload it to **GitHub**

❌ Share it on **Discord**

❌ Post it anywhere **publicly**

💀 If someone gets your private key, they can **steal all your funds** and take control of your account. Stay vigilant!

With this setup done, we’re now ready to integrate **Web3Auth** and build the login system for our dApp. Let’s go! 🚀
