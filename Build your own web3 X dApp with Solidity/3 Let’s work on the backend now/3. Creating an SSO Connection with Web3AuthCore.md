# Creating an SSO Connection with Web3AuthCore

Web3AuthCore is the backbone of authentication in our dApp. It allows us to set up a seamless **Single Sign-On (SSO) connection** with external authentication providers. But before we dive into logging in with X, we need to configure Web3AuthCore to interact with our blockchain.

### Setting Up Web3AuthCore

To get started, let's create an instance of Web3AuthCore and define the necessary backend configurations, including the **chain** where our contract is deployed.

```tsx
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from "@web3auth/base";

const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0xaa36a7", // Sepolia Testnet
    rpcTarget: "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID",
  },
});

web3auth.init();
```

### Whatâ€™s Happening Here?

- **`chainId = 0xaa36a7`** â†’ This is the identifier for the **Ethereum Sepolia test network**.
- **`chainNamespace = CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155`** â†’ Ensures that Web3AuthCore knows itâ€™s dealing with an **EVM-compatible chain**.
- **`rpcTarget`** â†’ Instead of QuickNode, we are now using **Infura** to interact with the Ethereum network.

With this setup, Web3AuthCore is now initialized and ready to roll! ðŸŽ‰

## Configuring OpenLogin for Twitter Authentication

You might be wonderingâ€”**whereâ€™s the SSO login?** Well, Web3AuthCore doesnâ€™t handle it alone. It needs an **OpenLogin adapter** to connect with authentication providers like **Twitter**.

### Setting Up OpenLogin

To integrate Twitter login, we need to configure OpenLogin on the **Web3Auth Developer Portal**:

1. Go to [Web3Auth Developer Portal](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and log in.
2. Click on **Create Project**.

3. Once the project is created, click on **Custom Auth** in the side menu.

4. Click **Create Verifier** â†’ Choose **Auth0** as the login provider.

5. Select **Twitter** from the authentication options.
6. Add temporary values for **Auth0 Client ID** and **Auth0 Domain** (weâ€™ll generate actual values soon).
7. Click **Create**, and boomâ€”your verifier is ready! ðŸš€

### Setting Up Auth0

Now, letâ€™s configure Auth0 to get the actual **Client ID** and **Domain**:

1. Go to [Auth0 Developer Portal](https://auth0.com/) and log in.
2. Click **Create Application** â†’ Choose **Single Page Web Applications** â†’ Click **Create**.

3. Once the app is created, **copy** the **Client ID** and **Domain**.

![image.png](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20your%20own%20web3%20X%20dApp%20with%20Solidity/3.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20work%20on%20the%20backend%20now/3.%20Creating%20an%20SSO%20Connection%20with%20Web3AuthCore/image%205.webp?raw=true)

4. Scroll down to **Application Login URI & Allowed Web Origins**, and add:
    
    ```
    https://beta.openlogin.com/auth/
    ```
    

This step ensures that Web3AuthCore can securely communicate with Auth0 via OpenLogin.

## Adding SSO to Our dApp

Now, let's **add the final piece of the puzzle**â€”configuring OpenLogin inside our app:

```tsx
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const clientId = "<client_id_from_web3auth_dashboard>";

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
    adapterSettings: {
        clientId,
        network: "testnet",
        uxMode: "popup",
        whiteLabel: {
            name: "Twitter DApp",
            logoLight: "<hosted-logo-image-link>",
            logoDark: "<hosted-logo-image-link>",
            defaultLanguage: "en",
            dark: true, // Enables dark mode
        },
        loginConfig: {
            jwt: {
                name: "Custom Auth Login",
                Verifier: "<client_verifier_from_Auth0_dashboard>",
                typeOfLogin: "twitter",
                clientId: "<clientId_from_Auth0_dashboard>",
            },
        },
    },
});

web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

### Whatâ€™s Happening Here?

- We initialize **OpenLogin** and link it to **Web3AuthCore**.
- The **Twitter authentication** setup is completed using our Auth0 credentials.
- The user can now sign in with Twitter and get authenticated **without managing private keys**.

Now, youâ€™re all set to move on to integrating the frontend with these authentication flows! ðŸš€
