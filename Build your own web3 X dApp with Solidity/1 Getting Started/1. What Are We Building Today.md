# What Are We Building Today?

Hey fam! Today, we’re diving into something super exciting – building our very own decentralized X dApp 🐦!

### 🤔 Why Are We Building This?

Lately, there's been a *huge* debate around data privacy, ownership, and how social media giants rake in billions by selling your data. The reality? The top ten tech companies control most of the world’s digital data. That means your personal info, browsing habits, and even your decisions are being monetized without your control.

It’s time to flip the script. With Web3, we can build a decentralized internet where *you* own your data. So, while learning Solidity and the Web3 ecosystem, why not create a decentralized version of X – a dApp where users own their posts, vote on content, and even buy tweets as NFTs?

### 📚 Course Overview

Here’s the game plan – we’re building a fully-functional X dApp with these epic features:

1. Sign in via X using **Web3Auth**
2. Write tweets as **NFTs**
3. Upvote and comment on tweets
4. **Buy** tweets on **OpenSea**
5. Integrate with **Torus Wallet** and **WalletConnect**

This isn’t just a theory class – we’re going full-stack, end-to-end, real-world dApp. By the end, you’ll know how to take a Web3 idea and turn it into a working product!

### 🧰 The Tech Stack

We’ll focus on three key areas of building an end-to-end (E2E) dApp:

1. **Smart Contracts** – The heart of any Web3 project
2. **Backend** – Connecting blockchain to real-world logic
3. **Frontend** – Crafting a slick user experience

Most of our time will be on the **smart contracts** and **backend**, but don’t worry – we’ll touch on the frontend enough to get everything working smoothly.

🧑‍💻 **Code Repo:** All code snippets are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/). Dive deeper anytime!

### 🛠️ What Skills Will You Learn?

By the end of this course, you’ll be packing some serious Web3 firepower:

1. Implement **Social Login** using **Web3Auth**
2. Use **QuickNode RPC** for rapid blockchain access
3. Write smart contracts in **Solidity**
4. Mint NFTs using **ERC-721**
5. Integrate with **OpenSea** to buy and sell tweets
6. Use **OpenZeppelin** libraries for easier development
7. Build a **React** frontend that mimics X’s homepage
8. Connect to **Torus Wallet** and **MetaMask**
9. Deploy an **End-to-End** decentralized application
10. Use **Remix IDE** for smart contract testing

Feeling overwhelmed? Don’t be! This tutorial is beginner-friendly – we break everything down step by step. 💪

### ✅ Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have these set up:

1. **VSCode** – [Download & Configure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX6xb8sRlFc&ab_channel=SmartContractProgrammer) for Solidity
2. **Node.js** – [Install here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. **MetaMask** – Installed and ready to roll
4. **X dApp Boilerplate** – [Grab it here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/X-dapp-boilerplate)

👉 **MetaMask vs. Torus Wallet:**

- **MetaMask** – For deploying smart contracts via **Remix IDE**
- **Torus Wallet** – For seamless **Web3Auth** social logins

We’ll cover both, so you’ll be a wallet integration pro by the end.
