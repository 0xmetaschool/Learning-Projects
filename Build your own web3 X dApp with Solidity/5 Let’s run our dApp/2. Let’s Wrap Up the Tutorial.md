# Letâ€™s Wrap Up the Tutorial

Alright, letâ€™s celebrate your journey in building a full-fledged decentralized application! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve made incredible progress, and now it's time to reflect on what we've accomplished:

## 1. Building a Smart Contract

We kicked things off by writing our very own **smart contract** using **Solidity** and deploying it through the **Remix IDE**. This laid the foundation for our decentralized application (dApp).

## 2. Exploring the Backend

Next, we explored the **backend landscape**, diving into **Web3Auth** and learning how to integrate authentication solutions like **Torus Wallet** and **WalletConnect**. These tools helped us enhance the security and accessibility of our dApp.

## 3. Crafting the Frontend

We then set up a **detailed React project**, bringing everything together with a well-structured UI that seamlessly interacted with our smart contract and authentication providers. This step allowed us to **test, tweak, and play around with our dApp** in a real-world setting.

## **ðŸš€ Keep Experimenting!**

Now that you have a fully functional dApp, we **encourage you to run it on your local server** and experiment further. Try implementing new features, optimizing gas fees, or even integrating different wallets to gain deeper insights into the Web3 ecosystem.
