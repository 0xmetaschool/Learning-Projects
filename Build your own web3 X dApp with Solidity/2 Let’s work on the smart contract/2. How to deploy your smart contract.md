# How to deploy your smart contract

## 🚀 Deploying Our Smart Contract on Sepolia Testnet

This is where the real magic of the **Remix IDE** comes to life! Remix makes deploying and interacting with smart contracts **super easy**—let’s dive in! 🎯

### 🛠 Setting Up for Deployment

Before we begin, ensure you have **MetaMask** installed on your browser. If you haven’t done this yet, check out our tutorial [here](https://metaschool.so/course/understand-and-setup-metamask-account).

Once you have MetaMask set up and connected to the **Sepolia Testnet**, you're all set to deploy your contract!


## 🔨 Compiling the Smart Contract

1️⃣ Open **Remix IDE** and navigate to the **Compile** tab.

2️⃣ Click on **“Compile XDapp.sol”** and wait for the compilation to complete.

Once the contract is compiled successfully, we’re ready to deploy it!

## 🚀 Deploying to Sepolia Testnet

1️⃣ Go to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab (right below the compile tab).

2️⃣ Change the environment to **“Injected Provider - MetaMask”** to use your MetaMask wallet.

3️⃣ A MetaMask pop-up will appear. Now, ensure the following:

- ✅ You are connected to Remix.
- ✅ You are on the **Sepolia Testnet**.
- ✅ You have **Sepolia ETH** for gas fees. If you need some, grab it from a [faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/).

4️⃣ Select **TwitterDapp** from the contract dropdown and hit **Deploy**! 🚀

5️⃣ Confirm the transaction in MetaMask and wait for **10-15 seconds**. Once deployed, you will see the contract appear on the left sidebar.

**🔖 Important!** Copy your contract address and store it safely. Also, keep Remix open—we’ll need this for testing and frontend integration. 😉


## ✅ Checking Our Deployment on Infura

Let’s ensure everything is working correctly!

1️⃣ Head to your **Infura** dashboard.
2️⃣ Click on your **Sepolia project**.
3️⃣ Check the **API requests and metrics** to verify contract activity.

If you see activity, **congratulations! 🎉** You have successfully deployed your smart contract on Sepolia!
