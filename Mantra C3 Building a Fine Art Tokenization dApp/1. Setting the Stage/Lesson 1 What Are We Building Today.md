# What Are We Building Today

Hey there, MANTRA enthusiasts and blockchain pioneers! üëã

First off, a massive congratulations on completing the previous MANTRA Courses! You've already proven your dedication to mastering the MANTRA Chain, and now it's time to take your skills to the next level.  

If you haven't completed the previous courses yet, we strongly recommend that you complete the '[Introduction to MANTRA Chain](https://metaschool.so/courses/introduction-to-mantra-chain)' and '[Start Building on MANTRA Chain](https://metaschool.so/courses/building-on-mantra-chain)' courses first. These courses will give you the essential foundation in blockchain technology and the specific features of MANTRA Chain that you'll need to succeed in this more advanced course.

Now are you ready to dive into something super cool? Let's talk about collectibles tokenization!

### What Are Collectibles, Anyway?

Think about your favorite things. Maybe it's:

- Baseball cards
- Action figures
- Rare coins
- Comic books
- Or even digital art!

These are all collectibles ‚Äì stuff people love to own, trade, and show off.

### Now, What's This Tokenization Thing?

Imagine if you could turn your collectibles into digital tokens. Cool, right? That's what tokenization does! It's like giving your collectible a special digital twin that lives on the blockchain.

ü§î But why would we do this? Great question! Here's why:

1. **Share the love**: You can own a piece of a super expensive collectible.
2. **Trade anytime**: Buy or sell your tokens 24/7.
3. **No fakes**: The blockchain keeps everything legit.
4. **Show off globally**: Your digital token can be seen by people all over the world!

### From Trading Cards to Fine Art

Now, let's zoom in on something really exciting ‚Äì fine art tokenization!

Imagine transforming iconic paintings, sculptures, and even digital art into digital tokens, unlocking fractional ownership, and democratizing the art market. All powered by the secure, transparent infrastructure of MANTRA Chain!
