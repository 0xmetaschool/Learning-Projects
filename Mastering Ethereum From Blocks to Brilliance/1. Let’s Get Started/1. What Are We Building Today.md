gm everyone ðŸŒˆ, I am very excited to bring the exciting course for developers just like you, who want to dive deep into the Ethereum world!

So what are we building today? Today we will dive deep into the Etheruem Blockchain. YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT. I am going to introduce you to the exciting world of Etheruem Blockchain and give you a glimpse of it.

Why Etheruem Blockchain? Learning Etheruem Blockchain is SO important because it is the new Hot thing in Web3 world. Some of the famous projects, [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/), [Augur](https://www.augur.net/), [Golem](https://www.golem.network/), [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/), [Aave](https://aave.com/), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), all are built on the Etheruem Blockchain.

Not only this, users on Ethereum are drastically increasing: 232.29M unique users at a current level, up from 232.21M yesterday and up from 196.88M one year ago. Cool, isn't it?
