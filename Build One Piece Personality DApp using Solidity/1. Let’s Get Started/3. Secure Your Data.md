# Secure Your Data

Greetings folks! We have set up our project. Now we need private data to deploy the contracts so let’s see how we can secure that. And we will also fetch some API keys and other data that will be required later. Ikuzo (Let’s go!!)

## Create `.env` file

Let’s use `.env` file to store all the secrets and important keys related to your project so we can access this data whenever and wherever.

Create a file named `.env` in the folder `one-piece-dapp` and copy the following data in the file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
SUB_ID=<your-chainlink-vrf-subscription-id>
VRF_ADDRESS=<your-chainlink-vrf_address-id>
KEY_HASH=<your-chainlink-key_hash-id>
API_KEY=<your-abiscan-api>
```

- If a `gitignore` file is not created, create a file named `.gitignore` file in the folder `one-piece-dapp`. In the `gitignore` file, we’ll simply write `.env`, so that it tells git to ignore that file from future commits. And we do not accidentally push our secret data to the public.

## Get your private MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hackers can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

1. Open the MetaMask extension to find your private key.
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on the three dots on the right side and go to “Account Details”.
4. Click on “Show private key”.
5. Enter MetaMask password.
6. Copy your private key.
7. Replace `<your-private-key>` with your private key in the `.env` file.

## AbI scan API key

Now you need to have an API so follow the steps given below:

- Head over to [https://arbiscan.io/](https://arbiscan.io/).
- Login or signup to Abiscan. If you are signing up, make sure to verify your email address.
- After logging in, go to “API-KEYs” on the left navigation bar.
- If you don’t have an API key. Generate one by clicking on “+Add” button and giving an app name such as “one-piece-dapp”.
- After generating the key, copy your Api-Key Token.

- Replace `<your-abiscan-api>` with yours in the `.env` file.

## Chainlink

Follow the steps given below:

- Head over to [https://vrf.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia](https://vrf.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Click on “Connect wallet” and connect your MetaMask wallet.
- Copy “VRF Coordinator” and replace `<your-chainlink-vrf_address-id>` with yours in the `.env` file. I have pointed out the address in the following image for your ease.

- Copy the “Key Hash” address and replace `<your-chainlink-key_hash-id>` with yours in the `.env` file. I have pointed out the hash in the following image for your ease.

### Create subscription

- Next, click on Create Subscription:
  - Click on the “Create Subscription” button.

  - Sign the transaction.
  - Confirm the transaction.

  - Wait for a few seconds. Click on the “Add Funds” pop-up but move to the home page without adding any link.
- Now go back to “Home”. Under “My Subscriptions”, you’ll find the subscription you created just yet. Click on it and copy the subscription ID.

- Replace `<your-chainlink-vrf-subscription-id>` with your ID in the `.env` file.

### Fund your subscription

Now, we need to fund our subscription. Without adding funds to the subscription ID, you may face errors.

1. Click on the “Action” button present on the Subscription page.
2. Click on the “Fund Subscription” option.

3. Click on “Visit the Chainlink Arbitrum Sepolia Faucet” link and request “25 test LINK”.

4. Go back to Subscription page and enter 15 in the “Add Funds (LINK)” field and click on “Confirm” button.

Awesome, setting all of this was a lot but you did great! Now, you are all set up to start writing the code!

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we have learned how to secure our data using a `.env` file. Then we fetched the required data and utilized MetaMask wallet, Arbitrum faucet, ABIscan API, and Chainlink for that.

Now that our development environment is ready, we can move on to building our dApp. Stay tuned for the next adventure!
