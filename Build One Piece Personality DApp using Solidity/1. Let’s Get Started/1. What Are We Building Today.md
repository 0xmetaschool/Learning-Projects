# What Are We Building Today? 🎯

gm everyone! ☀️ We are beyond excited to bring you this course, where you'll build a Solidity-powered dApp and take your Web3 skills to the next level. Get ready to master Solidity and dApp development like a true pirate! 🏴‍☠️

## 🏗️ What Are We Building?

Today, we’re building our very own **One Piece Personality dApp**! Yes, you heard that right. Inspired by the legendary anime, One Piece, this dApp will determine which One Piece character you and your friends resemble the most! 🏴‍☠️⚡

This project isn't just about fun; it will also arm you with the skills needed to build dApps in the Web3 space. So, whether you're a Luffy, Zoro, or Nami, let’s set sail! 🚢

## 💡 Why Solidity?

Solidity is **the** programming language of Web3, and demand for Solidity developers is skyrocketing! 🚀 With over **200,000 Solidity devs** globally and **$250k max yearly salaries**, this skill is a golden treasure. Plus, an average of **128 new Solidity job postings** go live every month. Time to cash in on this opportunity!

📌 **Try the dApp Before We Build It!**

1. **Set up the project using Remix** (No need for Hardhat—let’s keep it simple!)
2. **Write Solidity code for One Piece personality sorting** 🏴‍☠️
3. **Deploy the smart contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet**
4. **Integrate Chainlink VRF & The Graph Protocol** for randomness & indexing 🔗
5. **Build the frontend with React and connect it to our contract**
6. **Deploy the final dApp and interact with it like a pro!**

🔥 **The most exciting part?** Stick around till Lesson 4 because we’ve got a major surprise waiting for you!
