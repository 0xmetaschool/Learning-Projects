# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ☀️ We are very excited to bring the course where you will build a project in Solidity to help you become a Solidity and dApp creation master.

So what are we building today? We will be building our very own One Piece Personality dApp. Yes, you heard it right, this is inspired by the anime classic, One Piece and we decided to test out which One Piece character you and your friends most resemble. This project will not only be super fun for you but will also equip you with the potential to build dApp in the web3 ecosystem.

Why Solidity? Solidity is the most popular language of web3 and is in demand too! There are ~200,000 Solidity developers and their maximum yearly salary is $250k. On average, 128 new jobs for Solidity developers are posted every month. 


Okay, before we start, why don’t we try out the dApp first? [Click here](https://onepiece-dapp.vercel.app/) to try out the fun dApp. Or see in the gif below, how it looks like:

## Course Overview

We will:

1. Set up basic project using Hardhat
2. Learn how to code One Piece personality sorting in Solidity
3. Deploy the smart contracts on the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet
4. Learn how to use Chainlink VRF and The Graph Protocol
5. Set up the React frontend and integrate it with the Solidity smart contract (backend)
6. Deploy the final dApp and interact with it

- **Keep your momentum going! After the 4th lesson, I’ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can’t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for intermediate web3 developers who want to upskill their dApp building and Solidity command. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), Solidity Programming language, and frontend technologies because in this course we will focus more on building and deploying our dApp. Don’t worry! If you don’t know the basics we got you covered, you can always reach out to us for any help.

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your MetaMask if you still hasn’t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.
