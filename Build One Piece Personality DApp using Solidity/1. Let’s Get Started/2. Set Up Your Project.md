# Set Up Your Project

Greetings folks! Let’s dive right into setting up our project. Let’s go!!

## Prerequisites to setting up your project

- Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed in your system.
- Make sure you have installed a [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in your system. If the node is installed, make sure it is up-to-date. We are using `v18.17.1`. You can check yours using the `node --version` command.
- If you do not have the MetaMask extension, you can install it in your browser using the [Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

## Setting up the testnet environment

Now we need to set the testnet network so we can deploy our app on it. Complete the following steps to set it up:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/421614](https://chainlist.org/chain/421614).
- Click on the “Add to Metamask” button.

- Click on “Approve” and then “Switch network”.

You will be successfully connected to the Arbitrum Sepolia network. See in the following gif how we did it:

### Get some fake ETH $$ 🤑

Now it's time to get some money, just like Nami!

- Copy your account address from MetaMask.
- Head over to [https://www.l2faucet.com/arbitrum](https://www.l2faucet.com/arbitrum).
- Paste your wallet address.
- Click on the “Select Tokens” button.
- Choose the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet option.
- Click on the "Get Tokens" button.
- Choose any option to create a passkey. I choose Google profile. It's a necessary step to verify that the user is not a bot. Then click on the Continue button.
- Click on the "Attest and get my tokens" button.
- After some time, you will receive 0.01 ETH in your account.


## Set up the Hardhat project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```
mkdir one-piece-dapp
cd one-piece-dapp
npm install --save-dev hardhat@2.20.0
```

Initialize a new Hardhat project using the following command:

```
npx hardhat init
```

You will see an output like shown below. Select Javascript project and hit Enter for all other options:

Install all dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox dotenv @openzeppelin/contracts@^4.9.6 @chainlink/contracts@^0.8.0
```

Just like Sunny Go is always ready to take our crew anywhere they want; our development environment is also set to take us to the next level. I hope you got my One Piece reference…..

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we got some fake ETHs, set up our Hardhat project, and installed the necessary dependencies. Next, we will learn to secure necessary data.
