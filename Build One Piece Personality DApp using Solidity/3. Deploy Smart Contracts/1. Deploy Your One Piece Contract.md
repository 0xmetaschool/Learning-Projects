# Deploy Your One Piece Contract

Welcome back! You did great in the last lesson, coding all smart contracts. This lesson will teach you to set up your deployment script, config file, and finally deploy our smart contract. Let’s start this awesome journey!

## Creating the deployment script

Navigate to the `scripts` folder and remove the existing content of `deploy.js`. Let’s write our new code in `deploy.js`. The complete code for `deploy.js`:

```
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const fs = require("fs");
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  const vrfCoordinatorV2Address = process.env.VRF_ADDRESS; // address of the VRFCoordinatorV2 contract
  const subId = process.env.SUB_ID; // subscription ID for Chainlink VRF
  const keyHash = process.env.KEY_HASH; // key hash for Chainlink VRF
  const gasLimit = 2500000; 

  const argumentsArray = [vrfCoordinatorV2Address, subId, keyHash, gasLimit ]
  const content = "module.exports = " + JSON.stringify(argumentsArray, null, 2) + ";";
  fs.writeFileSync("./arguments.js", content);
  console.log("arguments.js file generated successfully.");

  // Deploying OnePiecePersonalityDapp contract
  const OnePiecePersonalityDapp = await ethers.getContractFactory("OnePieceMint");

  console.log("Deploying OnePiecePersonalityDapp...");

  const onePiecePersonalityDapp = await OnePiecePersonalityDapp.deploy(
    vrfCoordinatorV2Address, 
    subId, 
    keyHash,
    gasLimit);

  console.log("OnePiecePersonalityDapp deployed to:", await onePiecePersonalityDapp.getAddress()); 

}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

This script deploys a contract named One Piece Personality Dapp (`OnePieceMint` contract) using Hardhat. Here's what it does:

- Imports required modules such as ethers, fs, and dotenv.
- Loads environment variables from a .env file using dotenv.
- Defines the main function `main()` for deploying contracts.
- Gets the deployer's signer using ethers.
- Retrieves necessary parameters (VRF address, subscription ID, key hash, gas limit) from environment variables.
- Prepares an arguments array for contract deployment and saves it to a file named `arguments.js`. This file helps us pass the arguments to our `OnePieceMint` contract. So that we don’t get confused.
- Deploys the `OnePiecePersonalityDapp` contract with provided arguments.
- Logs the address where the contract is deployed.
- Handles errors and exits the script with appropriate status codes.

## Update `hardhat.config.js`

We need to add the wallet and network details so Hardhat knows who is deploying on which network. Open `hardhat.config.js` and replace the existing content with the following:

```
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify");

const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();

function privateKey() {
  return process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [];
}

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    mumbai: {
      url: "https://polygon-mumbai-pokt.nodies.app",
      accounts: privateKey(),
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: "https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io",
      accounts: privateKey(),
    },
    arbitrum_sepolia: {
      url: "https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc",
      accounts: privateKey(),
    }
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.20",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 1000,
      },
    },
  },  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY, 
  },
};
```

## Deploy the contracts

Now we are ready to compile the contracts using the following command:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network arbitrum_sepolia
```

You will see an output like this:

You will notice that the new folder named `artifacts` is created in `one-piece-dapp`. We need the JSON files of our contracts created on the front end.

You will also notice that while deploying the contract, a new file `arguments.js` file is created. This file is used to pass the arguments to the `OnePieceMint` contract.

## Verify the contract

Now we need to verify the contract. Why do we need to verify? We are importing multiple contracts in our `OnePieceMint` contract and they are importing more contracts. In the future, they might be changed. Verifying the contract makes us deploy those contracts with our contracts. Here’s how you can do this. 

1. First, copy the contract address from your deployment output.
    
    ![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/one-piece-dapp/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/deploy-output_(1).webp)
    
2. Run the following command and replace `<your-contract-address>` with your contract address. 

```
npx hardhat verify --constructor-args arguments.js <your-contract-address> --network arbitrum_sepolia
```

You will get the following output after deploying the contract.

![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/one-piece-dapp/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/deploy-2_(2).webp)

## Add consumers to Chainlink

Next, we will follow the following steps to add consumers to Chainlink:

- Copy the contract addresses of the contract you have just deployed.
- Head over to [https://vrf.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia](https://vrf.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia).
- Click on the subscription ID you are using.
- Click on “Add consumer”.
- Paste your contract address.
- Click on “Add consumer”.
- Click on “Confirm” to approve the transaction.

See how I did it in the following gif:

![](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/one-piece-dapp/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/Frame_3560365_(29).webp)

Repeat the same process for the other contract address.

And with this, we are ready to move on to the next step!

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you learned how to compile and deploy smart contracts using the Hardhat framework. You also created a deployment script for compiling the Solidity smart contracts, `OnePieceMint`, and verified the contract.

We will work on the front end in the next lesson.
