# Using SPL-CLI

Now since we are done with the most hectic part (setting up the environment üòÖ) we can move to the fun part of creating the token and deploying it to Solana Devnet.

Trust me this process will only take like 5-10 mins. Creating a token on Solana is the easiest!

Start with opening your CLI and write

```
cargo install spl-token-cli
```

Since we have installed the Solana Tool Suite already, this command will install the SPL-Token-CLI.

I know you all are unfamiliar with ‚ÄòCargo‚Äô. Don't get intimidated, it's nothing but a command similar to ‚Äúyarn‚Äù and ‚Äúnpm‚Äù for the Rust environment.

After installation of Solana CLI is finished we can move on to creating a Solana wallet.

Use this command to generate a new wallet which we will be using to interact with Solana Devnet.

```
solana-keygen new --no-outfile
```

Note: Leave the BIP39 passphrase empty and press enter if you don‚Äôt have your own passphrase.

Since we have created our Solana wallet, let‚Äôs set our network configuration to Devnet using the following command:

```
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

To check if our network is configured with the devnet, use the following command,

```
solana config get
```

If you have configured your SPL-CLI correctly, you will get an output like this:

Now, we need some testnet SOL to pay for the transaction fees on the network and we can use the following command to get some FREE SOL.

```
solana airdrop 1
```

This command will transfer 1 SOL to the wallet you will have just created using the CLI.

To check your Solana wallet balance, use the following command:

```
solana balance
```

And just like that we're done with the initial coding part, let‚Äôs deploy the token to Solana Devnet. LFG guys!!! üî•
