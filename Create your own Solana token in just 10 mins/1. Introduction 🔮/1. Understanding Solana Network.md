Understanding Solana Network
----------------------------

Hey fam, this is Aswin and today I will teach you how to launch your own token on Solana Blockchain.

This course will be super interesting because the SPL token isn't much talked about even though Solana is one of the largest blockchain networks around.

Before we start, let's talk about Solana and what makes it different from other blockchains 👇🏼

### What is Solana?

Solana is a blockchain platform that enables the hosting of decentralized, scalable apps. It was established in 2017 and is an open-source project that is now managed by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation. 

Compared to competing blockchains like Ethereum, Solana processes transactions substantially faster and charges significantly lower transaction fees. The Solana (SOLUSD) cryptocurrency, which uses the ticker symbol SOL, and is based on the Solana blockchain, experienced an almost 12,000% increase in 2021. 🫰🏼 At one point, it had a market valuation of over $66 billion, ranking it as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency at the time.

The Solana blockchain uses the proof-of-history consensus algorithm. The following block in Solana's chain is determined by this algorithm using timestamps. Solana also uses Delegated proof-of-stake in combination with PoH as its consensus.

### What is Proof-of History?

Proof of History is based on Proof of Stake but uses a separate clock to measure time. Today, historical occurrences are employed to estimate the passage of time. These occurrences are converted into a hash that can only be produced by earlier occurrences.

What if you could demonstrate that the message was sent before and after the occurrence, rather than relying solely on the timestamp? When you snap a picture of the New York Times cover, you are proving that it was taken after the newspaper was published or that you have some sort of control over what the New York Times publishes. You can produce a historical record that shows an event took place at a given point in time using Proof of History.

Hopefully that example was useful. Let's move on to the next lesson, but before you do that, remember to complete your assignment!
