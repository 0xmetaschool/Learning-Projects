# Into the World of Solana

Hey, folks! We’re so glad to see you here. Thank you for not dropping off and continuing your learning journey with us. In this lesson, you’ll go through the the Solana network, its history, and why we will be using Rust for this course.

## What is exactly Solana?

Solana is a blockchain platform that enables the hosting of decentralized, scalable apps. It was established in 2017 and is an open-source project that is now managed by the Geneva-based Solana Foundation.

Compared to competing blockchains like Ethereum, Solana processes transactions substantially faster and charges significantly lower transaction fees. The Solana (SOLUSD) cryptocurrency, which uses the ticker symbol SOL, and is based on the Solana blockchain, experienced an almost 12,000% increase in 2021. 🫰🏼 At one point, it had a market valuation of over $66 billion, ranking it as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency at the time.

The Solana blockchain uses the proof-of-history consensus algorithm. The following block in Solana's chain is determined by this algorithm using timestamps. Solana also uses Delegated proof-of-stake in combination with PoH as its consensus.

## What is Proof-of History?

Proof of History is based on Proof of Stake but uses a separate clock to measure time. Today, historical occurrences are employed to estimate the passage of time. These occurrences are converted into a hash that can only be produced by earlier occurrences.

What if you could demonstrate that the message was sent before and after the occurrence, rather than relying solely on the timestamp? When you snap a picture of the New York Times cover, you are proving that it was taken after the newspaper was published or that you have some sort of control over what the New York Times publishes. You can produce a historical record that shows an event took place at a given point in time using Proof of History.

## What is Rust?

A multi-paradigm, all-purpose programming language is called Rust. Performance, type safety, and concurrency are highlighted in Rust. Unlike other memory-safe languages, Rust maintains memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without necessitating the employment of a garbage collector or reference counting.

## Why we need Rust?

In essence, Solidity was developed to enable the creation of Smart Contracts for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. That is, Solidity is used for Ethereum smart contracts and all other blockchains that leverage Ethereum as a Layer 1 solution. You can send tokens to a wallet using that way because Solidity has been best suited for handling smart contract transactions in Ethereum-based blockchains with modifiers like payable. Additionally, Solidity is so user- and developer-friendly that it enables you to create straightforward smart contracts in a matter of minutes.

But in Solana, Rust is the preferred language for creating smart contracts. Rust's ability to produce extremely efficient apps with total control over memory and cache management, trash collection, etc. is the key justification for using it.

As a result, it makes it possible for dApps created using Rust to be extremely efficient and use far less gas than dApps created with Solidity, and consequently, Ethereum.
