# What Are We Building Today

gm everyone ðŸŒž, Iâ€™m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about building the token on Solana network for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we will learn how to create your own SPL token in 10 mins. It will be a simple, step-by-step process. This course will be super interesting because the SPL token isn't much talked about even though Solana is one of the largest blockchain networks around the world.

Why Solana? Solana was designed to improve Ethereum and work similarly like it. It has become so much popular that its coin is ranked 11th largest coin by total market capitalization. Solana uses Proof-of-stake, which makes it consume less energy and resources.

Not only this, as of now, more than 350 dApps have been shipped on the Solana blockchain.

## Course overview

We will cover:

- Basic understanding of Solana network
- How to create SPL Token
- Using Solana CLI
- Token deployment on Solana Devnet

**Keep your momentum going! In lesson 3rd and 4th, weâ€™ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I canâ€™t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who are looking advance their knowledge. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain ecosystem and [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/) because in this course we will focus more on basics of Solana network and how you can deploy a token on Solana.

## Prerequisites

This is the most important part because the CLI we will be using to create this token has a lot of dependencies and we have to make sure that we set the environment for Solana to run perfectly!

Moving on, we will be using cargo to create the token. Cargo is the NPM or Yarn version of Rust, so we'll need to install Rust and set up its dependencies correctly. Lastly, install the Solana Tool Suite to create our token which also depends on Rust.

Hereâ€™s some pre-installations you need in this course.

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed
- [Solana Tool Suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) installed
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed

Donâ€™t worry! We will walk you through the important installations in upcoming lessons.
