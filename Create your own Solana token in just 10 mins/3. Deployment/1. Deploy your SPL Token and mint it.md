# Deploy Your SPL Token and Mint It

This is the final part üîÆ

I know you guys are really excited so I think I must not talk much and begin the deployment of our SPL token on the Solana devnet.

By the way, SPL token is not the name of the token but it is a token standard used by the Solana ecosystem like ERC-20 for Ethereum.

## Now, let‚Äôs begin with token creation

You can use the following command to create a token and deploy it. Yes you heard me right, you can create and deploy the token with just a SINGLE command,

```
spl-token create-token
```

Now after you have created a token you will receive a token address with a signature (Transaction Hash). Copy the token address as this is what you will need further on.

Just hold your heart for the next 1-2 mins and you will have your token minted too!

Before minting the token, we need to create an account to store the token as Solana blockchain doesn‚Äôt have storage by default. Hence we will manually assign storage for our token..

Use the following command to create a account:

```
spl-token create-account <token-address>
```

Now mint your token to the newly created account. Use the following command to mint your token:

```
spl-token mint <token-address> <token-amount>
```

Congratulations! your have successfully created and deployed your SPL token to Solana devnet.

Let‚Äôs check our newly created token on the Solana devnet explorer,

- Go to [https://explorer.solana.com/supply?cluster=devnet](https://explorer.solana.com/supply?cluster=devnet)
- Search your token with the address you copied

As you can see, we have our token deployed on the devnet of Solana Blockchain and the name of the token is showing as ‚ÄúUnknown Token‚Äù because in case of SPL tokens, you need to pull the SPL token repository of Solana and add your token to the list for the Solana blockchain to recognize its name and symbol.

For the devnet, we don‚Äôt have an option to add our token to the list but you can replicate this process for the mainnet and update the official SPL token list.

To deploy on the mainnet you just need to change solana config line to,

```
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

and also, you need to buy and transfer the Solana wallet you create to pay for the transaction as mainnet does not have a faucet for you get FREE SOL.

That's all, wasn't this fun?
