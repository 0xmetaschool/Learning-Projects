Not only this, Flow has 11K active developers and over 20M user accounts. Yep! they are pretty dope and started the movement of crypto games on blockchain.

## Course overview

Together we will:

1. Learn everything about Flow Blockchain, smart contracts, and tokens. 
2. Discover the *language* the Flow Blockchain uses to do all the amazing stuff. 

Not only this, I will teach you how you can write and deploy your own smart contracts and tokens on Flow Blockchain. Cool, right?!

## So, who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginners web3 developers who wish to learn about the Flow blockchain and how they can create smart contracts using the.

## Prerequisites

Learning the Flow blockchain programming language will be much easier if you are familiar with Object-Oriented programming. Since programming language, the Flow Blockchain uses, is a high-level resource-oriented programming language, having OOP concepts will be very helpful.

**Don‚Äôt Worry!** I will teach you everything from scratch. So don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by reading the complicated concept like resource-oriented programming.
