# What is Flow Blockchain?

Hey guys, are you ready to get your minds blown? It's time to dive into the amazing world of the Flow blockchain!

Now, I know what you're thinking, "why should we care about this so much?" Trust me, you're gonna wanna stick around for this course. You're gonna learn all about how Flow works, why it's important, and how you can get involved in this revolutionary technology. Get ready to have your mind blown, because this is gonna be a wild ride!

## What the heck is a Flow blockchain?

First off, you're probably wondering, "what the heck is a Flow blockchain?" Well, let me tell you, it's this incredible system that makes digital transactions super fast and secure.

And Flow isn't just some fancy tech that only computer wizards can understand. It's actually used for all kinds of things, like buying and selling digital art, playing games, and even voting!

Well, for starters, it's way faster and easier to use than other blockchain platforms like Ethereum. Plus, it was created by the brilliant folks over at Dapper Labs, the same people who brought us iconic dApps like CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot!

With Flow, you can make all sorts of amazing decentralized apps that are gonna revolutionize the way you live and work.

## Flow network

Flow is a network that uses a fancy system (consensus mechanism) called "proof of stake" to make sure everything runs smoothly. To participate in the network, people called "validators" have to put in a specific number of tokens called "FLOW tokens". It's like putting some coins into a game before you can play. That way, everyone is invested in making sure everything works great!

## How does Flow work?

With Flow Blockchain, things work a little differently than other blockchains. Instead of just one type of node doing all the work, there are actually four different types of nodes that each have their own job.

We've got the consensus node, the verification node, the execution node, and the collection node. And get this, all four of these types of nodes work together to make sure every transaction is validated properly. Pretty cool, huh?

## Whatâ€™s so special about Flow?

Flow Blockchain is perfect for creating cool, interactive crypto experiences that are becoming super popular these days. And the best part? These experiences can reach way more people in the future!

Just look at NBA Top Shot, which is a collectibles experience that uses Flow. It's already making crazy amounts of money and getting lots of attention from people who aren't even into crypto. And that's just one example of what Flow can do! There are gonna be tons of other awesome experiences coming our way soon. Get ready to be blown away!

## What can you do with Flow?

So if you want to start using Flow Blockchain, there are a few options for you. You can check out NBA Top Shot or VIV3 NFT marketplace and buy some cool artwork there. Or, you can try out some of the other apps that are already up and running on the blockchain.

As you're a developer, you're in luck! Flow has lots of built-in tools that you can use to start experimenting and creating your own dapps. So whether you're both a user and a developer, there are tons of ways to get involved with Flow and start exploring all the amazing possibilities it has to offer!

## Wrap up

In this course, I'll show you all the development tools you need to start experimenting and creating on the Flow blockchain.

And in the next lesson, I'll talk about something called "resource-oriented programming and architecture." It might sound fancy, but don't worry, I'll explain it all in a way that's easy to understand. After that, I'll dive into the programming language that Flow uses.

So buckle up and get ready for an awesome ride! You're gonna be a Flow Blockchain pro in no time! ðŸš€
