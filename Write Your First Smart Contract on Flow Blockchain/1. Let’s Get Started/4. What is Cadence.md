# What is Cadence?

Hey there, welcome back! Last time you had a blast learning about resource-oriented programming (ROP) and how it's used in the Cadence programming language. I even compared it to another programming model called object-oriented programming (OOP)!

Now, are you ready to get even more pumped up? In this lesson, you're going to go all-in on Cadence programming language and explore all its amazing features. Get ready to take your programming skills to the next level! ðŸ’ª

## What is Cadence?

So when people want to create apps for the Flow blockchain, they use a programming language called Cadence to go with super-fast and efficient blockchain.

Using Cadence makes it easier for developers to write code that works well on the Flow network. So, if you're interested in making your own apps for the blockchain, Cadence is definitely something you'll want to check out!

## Why use Cadence?

One of the really neat things about Cadence is that it's the first high-level, resource-oriented programming language out there. That just means it's really good at helping you work with resources in your code - like digital assets on the Flow blockchain, for example.

### Cadence resources

The resources in Cadence are really cool because they're based on linear data types, which means they can only exist in one place at a time. So, if you own an NFT (which is a type of digital asset), that NFT is stored directly in your account and can't be duplicated or copied somewhere else.

### Cadence security

Resources are really important because it means that the ownership of digital assets on Flow is defined directly in the Cadence language itself, which helps to remove the risks that can come with storing balances on a centralized digital ledger. It's kind of like having a really secure, tamper-proof safe for your digital assets!

### Final thoughts

So, if you're interested in working with digital assets on the Flow blockchain, Cadence is definitely the way to go. Its resource-oriented programming language makes it easy to work with these assets and ensure their ownership is secure and protected.

## Cadence Features

Cadence is built on pillars and here are those five pillars:

- **Safety and security:** Cadence ensure smart contracts are secure and only accessible to authorized parties.
- **Clarity:** The way Cadence is written makes it easy to understand what the code is doing, which makes it easier to write, read, and check for errors.
- **Approachability:** Cadence's syntax and structure are based on popular programming languages like Swift and Rust, so it's easy for developers to get started with it. Plus, there are lots of resources available to help them learn more and troubleshoot any issues they may run into.
- **Developer experience:** The Flow ecosystem provides support and resources to developers throughout the entire development process, from start to finish.
- **Intuitive ownership with resources:** Cadence's use of resources means that asset ownership is built right into the code itself. This means assets are tied to specific accounts and can be transferred without the need for a smart contract.

## Wrap up

You've made it so far, and you're already a blockchain expert! You learned all about the Flow Blockchain, resource-oriented programming, and even got a taste of the amazing Cadence programming language and its cool features!

Now, it's time to kick it up a notch and dive headfirst into Cadence programming language.

You're going to learn all the basics and start coding in the Flow blockchain. Are you excited? I sure am!

Don't give up now, keep pushing through and soon you'll be writing awesome code! You got this, let's go! ðŸš€
