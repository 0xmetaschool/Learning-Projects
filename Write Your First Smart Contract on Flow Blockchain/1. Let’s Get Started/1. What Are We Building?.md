Not only this, I will teach you how you can write and deploy your own smart contracts and tokens on Flow Blockchain. Cool, right?!

## So, who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginners web3 developers who wish to learn about the Flow blockchain and how they can create smart contracts using the.

## Prerequisites

Learning the Flow blockchain programming language will be much easier if you are familiar with Object-Oriented programming. Since programming language, the Flow Blockchain uses, is a high-level resource-oriented programming language, having OOP concepts will be very helpful.
