So what are we building today? Today we‚Äôre gonna write a smart contract and a token on Flow Blockchain. YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT. I am going to introduce you to the exciting world of Flow Blockchain and give you a small glimpse of it.

Why Flow Blockchain? Because some of the biggest projects in web3 ecosystem [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/), [NFL All Day](https://nflallday.com/),¬†[Collab.land](https://www.collab.land/)¬†etc are in the Flow Blockchain and Metaschool want you to get ahead of 90% developers.

Not only this, Flow has 11K active developers and over 20M user accounts. Yep! they are pretty dope and started the movement of crypto games on blockchain.

## Course overview

Together we will:

1. Learn everything about Flow Blockchain, smart contracts, and tokens.
2. Discover the _language_ the Flow Blockchain uses to do all the amazing stuff.

Not only this, I will teach you how you can write and deploy your own smart contracts and tokens on Flow Blockchain. Cool, right?!

## So, who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginners web3 developers who wish to learn about the Flow blockchain and how they can create smart contracts using the language of the Flow Blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Learning the Flow blockchain programming language will be much easier if you are familiar with Object-Oriented programming. Since programming language, the Flow Blockchain uses, is a high-level resource-oriented programming language, having OOP concepts will be very helpful.

**Don‚Äôt Worry!** I will teach you everything from scratch. So don‚Äôt get overwhelmed by reading the complicated concept like resource-oriented programming.
