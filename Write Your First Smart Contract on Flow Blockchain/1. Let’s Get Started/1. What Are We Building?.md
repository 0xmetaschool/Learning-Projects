## Course overview

Together we will:

Not only this, I will teach you how you can write and deploy your own smart contracts and tokens on Flow Blockchain. Cool, right?!

## So, who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginners web3 developers who wish to learn about the Flow blockchain and how they can create smart contracts using the language of the Flow Blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Learning the Flow blockchain programming language will be much easier if you are familiar with Object-Oriented programming. Since programming language, the Flow Blockchain uses, is a high-level resource-oriented programming language, having OOP concepts will be very helpful.

**Donâ€™t Worry!** I will teach you everything from scratch. So donâ€™t get overwhelmed by reading the complicated concept like resource-oriented programming.
