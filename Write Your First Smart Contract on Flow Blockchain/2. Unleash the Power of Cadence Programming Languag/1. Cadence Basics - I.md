# Cadence Basics - I

Welcome back! üéâ Remember what I talked about in the last lesson? You learned about Cadence and how it works. Well, get ready because in this lesson, you're going to dive into the fun part - coding in Cadence! You'll explore composite types and contracts. You‚Äôll learn how contracts work and learn about their basic structure. Are you excited? Let's get started!

## Composite types in Cadence

Composite types are like building blocks that let you combine simpler types to create more complex ones. There are two types of Composite types in Cadence.

1. `resource`: Resource can only be used exactly once.
2. `struct`: One Struct can have different objects just like in C++ or GoLang.

### Composite type declaration

Let‚Äôs look at how you can declare a `resource` and `struct`.

**Resource**

You can declare a resource using `resource` keyword.

```
<visibilitySpecifier> resource ResourceName {
			// ...
}
```

**Struct**

You can declare a structure using `struct` keyword.

```
<visibilitySpecifier> struct StructName {
			// ...
}
```

> **Note:** Visibility specifiers defines who can access the type it has been written with. It defines whether the resource, struct, contract, variable, or function is public or private. If you don‚Äôt write any visibility specifier with the type it means that type is private by default.

### Composite type creation

Now let‚Äôs look at how you can create a `resource` and `struct`.

> **Note:** Remember that both structures and resources are types.

**Resource**

You can create and instantiate a `resource` using `<-`sign and`create` keyword.

```
// instantiate a new resource object and assign it to a constant
let constantName <- create SomeResource()
```

> **Don‚Äôt Worry!** You will go through the constants in the next lesson. Let‚Äôs just focus on resource and struct for now.

**Struct**

You can create and instantiate a `struct` by calling the type just like functions.

```
/ instantiate a new struct object and assign it to a constant
let constantName = StructName()
```

> **Fun fact:** Composite types can only be declared within a¬†contract and nowhere else.

### What can composite types hold in Cadence?

Both structures and resources can hold the following data.

- Variables of various types (e.g. String, Int, Array, Dictionary)
- Public and private functions
- Access control to ensure that only authorized parties can modify the composite types
- Constructors

## What is a contract in Cadence?

In Cadence, a contract is like a recipe that tells the Flow blockchain how a digital asset should behave and what state it should be in. Think of it as a blueprint for something like a special token or a cool NFT that you want to create.

### Basic contract structure

Here is how the basic structure of the definition of contract in Cadence looks like.

```
<visibilitySpecifier> contract ContractName {
			//...
}
```

A `contract` keyword is used to define the contract in Cadence. It will be necessary to use, wherever you want to create a smart contract in Cadence.

Here is an example of basic Cadence contract:

### What can a simple contract hold in cadence?

A simple contract in Cadence can additionally hold composite types, both structures and resources along with all the data, composite types can hold.

## What is an interface in Cadence?

Do you know what an interface is? ü§î It's like a blueprint for how different types of things should behave. For example, let's say you have a bunch of different types of animals, and you want them all to be able to make a sound. You could create an interface that says "any animal that implements this interface must have a function that makes a sound."

Interfaces also set rules for what kind of information and how much of it different types need to provide. It's like saying "if you want to be part of this group, you have to meet these specific requirements."

So, an interface is just a way to make sure that different types of things all behave the way they're supposed to. It's kind of like setting up a code of conduct!

There are three types of interfaces:

- **Structure interfaces**: implemented by¬†structures
- **Resource interfaces**: implemented by¬†resources
- **Contract interfaces**: implemented by¬†contracts

### Interfaces declaration

Interfaces are declared using `resource`, `struct`, or `contract` keyword followed by `interface` keyword along with the visibility specifier and the name of interface.

### What can interface hold in Cadence?

Interfaces consist of the function and field requirements.

**Function requirements**

When I talk about function requirements, it's basically what a function needs to have. This includes the function's name, the types of parameters it takes, and optionally what it returns. It can also have some extra conditions called preconditions and postconditions if necessary. These conditions help specify what needs to happen before and after the function runs.

**Field requirements**

Now, let's talk about field requirements. Fields are like variables that belong to a certain object or type. When I talk about field requirements, it means I'm specifying what a field should have. This includes the field's name and its type. Additionally, you can also add some extra requirements for getting and setting values to that field. These requirements can have their own preconditions and postconditions, which set some conditions that need to be met before and after getting or setting a value.

So, it's all about setting up the necessary conditions for functions and fields to make sure everything works smoothly!

## Wrap up

With simple and easy-to-understand code and lots of tools to work with, you can create all sorts of awesome decentralized apps and smart contracts. The possibilities are endless!

Get ready for the next lesson! You're going to dive deep into Cadence and cover everything from visibility specifiers to control flows. You're going to master it all! Don't lose your motivation now ‚Äì you've got this! üëç
