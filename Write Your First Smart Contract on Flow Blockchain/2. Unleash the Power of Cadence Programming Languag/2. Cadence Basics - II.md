# Cadence Basics - II

In the last lesson, you learned about contracts and their important role in defining digital assets on the Flow blockchain network. But did you know that in Cadence, contracts hold all the code, structures, resources, variables, functions, and constructors for a specific asset? That's right, you can't write variables or functions independently outside of a contract, resource, or struct.

But don't worry, in this lesson, you'll dive into the basics of Cadence and show you how to work with variables and functions along with other important features! Get ready to unleash your coding skills! ðŸš€

## Visibility specifiers

Visibility specifiers in Cadence control the accessibility of structures, resources, contracts, variables, and functions. There are following visibility specifiers in Cadence.

- **`pub` / `access(all)`**: a contract, variable, or function that can be accessed from other accounts or contracts on the Flow blockchain.
- **`priv` / `access(self)`**: a contract, variable, or function that can only be accessed within the scope where it is declared.
- **`access(account)`:** a contract, variable, or function that can be accessed anywhere within the same account it is deployed to (other contracts in the same account can access it).
- **`access(contract)`:** a contract, variable, or function that can be accessed anywhere within the same contract it is deployed to (other contracts cannot access it).

## Data Types

Data types in Cadence define the type of value that a variable can hold. Some of the Cadence data types are as follows:

- **`String`**: Use to define a sequence of characters
- **`Int`**: Use to define an integer value
- **`Bool`**: Use to define a boolean value (`true` or `false`)
- **`Address`**: Use to define an account address on the Flow blockchain

## Constructor

In Cadence, you can declare the constructor using `init` keyword inside the resource, struct, or contract. The basic syntax of a constructor in Cadence is as follows:

```
init() {
		// constructor code goes here
}
```

You can also pass parameters to the `init` as per needed.

> **Note:** Constructors are mostly used to initialize the variables with initial values.

## Composite type fields

In Cadence, there are two kind of fields: variables and constants. You can only initialize the fields with initial values in the initializer (`init`) and not in the field declaration.

Letâ€™s look at how two fields can be declared and when to change their values.

- **Constants**
  - Constants can be declared using `let` keyword.
  - Once you initialize the constant inside of the initializer (`init`) you cannot change its value later.
  - A constant field must be initialized exactly once.
- **Variables**
  - Variables can be declared using `var` keyword.
  - Once you initialize the variable inside of the initializer (`init`) you can change its value later.

> **Note:** In initializers, the special constantÂ `self`Â is used to refer to variables and constant those were declared inside the resource, struct, or contract.

## Constants

Constants in Cadence are declared using `let` keyword. The basic syntax of declaring a constant is as follows:

```
<visibilitySpecifier> let variableName: dataType
```

> **Note:** Visibility specifier is optional. If no visibility specifier is defined with constant, it means the constant is private by default.

### Example

Here is the constant declaration example in Cadence:

This is how you can intialize the above variable in a constructor.

```
self.greetings = "Hello"
```

> **Note:** The variables follow the same pattern for declaration and intialization, only difference is you can make changes in the variable after the initial intialization.

## Functions

You can declare functions in Cadence using the `fun` keyword just like you declare the functions in Solidity using `function` keyword. The basic syntax of a function in Cadence is as follows:

```
<visibilitySpecifier> fun functionName(<VariableName: DataType>): ReturnType {
    // Code block
}
```

- The visibility specifier is optional with function defination. If no visibility specifier is defined with function, it means the function is private by default.
- Parameters to the functions are also optional.

### Example

Here is the function example in Cadence:

## Comments

Comments in Cadence are used to document code and improve its readability.

### Single-line comment example:

```
// This is a comment
```

### Multi-line comment example:

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
```

## Control flow

Control flow statements in Cadence allow a program to make decisions based on conditions and repeat code until certain conditions are met. Following are some of the control flow statements examples.

### if-else statement example

```
if x > 0 {
    // Code to run if x is greater than 0
} else {
    // Code to run if x is less than or equal to 0
}
```

### while loop example

```
while x > 0 {
    // Code to repeat while x is greater than 0
    x -= 1
}
```

### for loop example

```
for i in 0...10 {
    // Code to repeat for each value of i from 0 to 10 (inclusive)
}
```
