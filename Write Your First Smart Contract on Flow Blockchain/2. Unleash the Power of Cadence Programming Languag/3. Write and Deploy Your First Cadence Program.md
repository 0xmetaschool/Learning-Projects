# Write and Deploy Your First Cadence Program

Hey there! So in the past two lessons, you got a good grasp of the basics of Cadence. But get ready for the fun part! In this lesson, you get to put your knowledge to the test and create a complete smart contract. You'll have the chance to deploy your smart contract using the Flow Playground. Let's get started!

## Writing the code

Let's start by writing the code for the `Greeting` smart contract.

```
// Greeting.cdc
pub contract Greeting {
    pub let greeting: String

    init() {
        self.greeting = "Welcome to Metaschool!"
    }

    pub fun sayWelcome(): String {
        return self.greeting
    }
}
```

Alright, hold up for a second! Before you jump into deploying your smart contract, let's explore what the Flow Playground is all about.

## What is Flow Playground?

Flow Playground is like a super cool web tool that lets developers create and test their own smart contracts right from their computer! With it, you can write, deploy, and play around with smart contracts on the Flow blockchain, all in one place.

This is how the Flow Playground looks like:

## What is an account in Flow Blockchain?

An account is like your very own space on the Flow blockchain. It's where you can store your digital assets, and it's protected by your own special code, called a public and private key pair. Think of it like your own personal locker at the gym! To access anything on the Flow blockchain, you need an account, and each account has a unique address to identify it.

Check out the awesome accounts section in the Flow Playground!

> **Note:** `0x01`, `0x02`, `0x03`‚Ä¶ represents the unique address of each account.

## Deploying a Smart Contract using Flow Playground

Now, let's deploy your `Greeting` smart contract using the Flow Playground.

### Navigate to the Flow Playground

First, navigate to the Flow Playground website at **[https://play.onflow.org/](https://play.onflow.org/)**.

### Copy-paste smart contract

In the `Contract 1.cdc`, copy and paste the following code `Greeting` smart contract.

```
// Greeting.cdc
pub contract Greeting {
    pub let greeting: String

    init() {
        self.greeting = "Welcome to Metaschool!"
    }

    pub fun sayWelcome(): String {
        return self.greeting
    }
}
```

### Edit name

In the `Contract` folder at sidebar, click on three dots in front of `Contract 1` and ‚ÄúEdit name‚Äù. Give your contract a name, such as "HelloWorld".

### Deploy smart contract

Open ‚ÄúLog‚Äù at the right bottom of the Playground page and click on the "Deploy" button to deploy your smart contract to the Flow blockchain.

![deploy.gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Write%20Your%20First%20Smart%20Contract%20on%20Flow%20Blockchain/2.%20Unleash%20the%20Power%20of%20Cadence%20Programming%20Languag/%F0%9F%9A%80%20Write%20and%20Deploy%20Your%20First%20Cadence%20Program%202b398ce82b784a50b2c3495ea5fa4249/deploy.webp?raw=true)

The ‚ÄúLog‚Äù will show you the following output.

![Untitled](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Write%20Your%20First%20Smart%20Contract%20on%20Flow%20Blockchain/2.%20Unleash%20the%20Power%20of%20Cadence%20Programming%20Languag/%F0%9F%9A%80%20Write%20and%20Deploy%20Your%20First%20Cadence%20Program%202b398ce82b784a50b2c3495ea5fa4249/Untitled%202.webp?raw=true)

The **`0x01`** represents the address of the account, the smart contract is deployed to.

## Run your smart contract

So far you have just deployed the smart contract. To run the smart contract and see the output head over the ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù at side bar. You will see something like this already written in the Transaction file:

```
import HelloWorld from 0x01

transaction {

  prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {}

  execute {
    log(HelloWorld.hello())
  }
}
```

Replace `HelloWorld` with `Greeting` and `hello` with `sayWelcome`. After making the changes click on ‚ÄúSend‚Äù and see the output of your Greeting contract in the ‚ÄúLogs‚Äù section.

Let‚Äôs see this happening live.
