# Letâ€™s Get Started With Tokens

Awesome job for coming so far! You've got the basics of Flow and Cadence down. But now, it's time to take things up a notch and jump into the world of tokens!

In this section of the course, we'll show you everything you need to know about tokens, including the different types of tokens that exist in the crypto world. You'll also learn about token standards in the Flow blockchain, which will help you create your own tokens with ease.

So, buckle up and get ready for an exciting ride!

## What exactly the tokens are

Tokens are super cool digital objects that represent something valuable! They can be used for buying things, playing games, or accessing certain online services. It's like having digital coins or tickets in your virtual wallet!

### Example

For example, imagine that you're at a carnival and you want to ride on the Ferris wheel. You'll need to buy a ticket first, which represents the value of the ride. Without the ticket, you can't go on the Ferris wheel. Just like that, digital tokens can represent different types of value, such as money or access to certain services.

In a video game, tokens can be used to buy items for your character. They act as a virtual currency that you can use within the game to purchase different things. Although these tokens have value within the game, they can't be used outside of it.

## Different kind of tokens

Letâ€™s learn what are the different types of tokens using real-world example to make you understand each token easily.

## Fungible Token

Letâ€™s explain Fungible Tokens by comparing them to candy.

Think of it like a bag of candy bars - all the candy bars are exactly the same, and you can trade one for another without any difference. Each candy bar is worth the same amount, and you can exchange them for something else of equal value.

Similarly, there are digital tokens that are also fungible, like "Star Coins" in a video game. Each Star Coin is worth the same amount as all the others, and you can use them to buy things in the game. You could trade one Star Coin for another, and it wouldn't make any difference.

So, a fungible token is something that can be exchanged for something else of equal value, just like candy bars or Star Coins. It's called "fungible" because all the tokens are the same, and you can't tell them apart.

## Non-Fungible Token

Letâ€™s expand our candy analogy to Non-Fungible Tokens now.

Imagine owning a collection of unique candy treats called "Magical Candy Friends." Each candy friend has its own special features, like Lollipop Larry with a swirl design and cherry flavor, and Bubblegum Bella, a round candy friend with a bubblegum flavor. Unlike regular candy bars, these Magical Candy Friends are one-of-a-kind and can't be directly exchanged for another. They have individual value and characteristics that make them special. Similarly, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique and can't be swapped with other NFTs on a one-to-one basis.

Digital tokens can be non-fungible too - just like a rare PokÃ©mon card in a card deck! It's the only card of its kind in the game, so you can't trade it for another one and expect it to be the same. That's because it's unique and special!

So, a non-fungible token is something that's rare and unique, and you can't swap it out for something else of equal value. It's called "non-fungible" because it's different from other tokens, and you can tell them apart easily!

## Tokens and Flow blockchain

Tokens on the blockchain are digital representations of all kinds of assets - from cryptocurrencies to digital collectibles and beyond! And on Flow, a powerful blockchain platform, you can create and manage your own tokens and smart contracts.

## What are Flow Token Standards?

Flow has its own set of token standards that define how these tokens can be created, managed, and exchanged on the platform. This means that you have all the tools you need to create unique and valuable digital assets that can be easily traded and managed on the Flow blockchain.

As you're a developer, you can use these cool rules and guidelines to create tokens on the Flow blockchain, and make sure they're compatible with other apps and wallets on the network. It's like having a secret code to unlock all the potential of the Flow platform!

So, what are these magical standards? There are actually two of them: **the Fungible Token Standard** and **the Non-Fungible Token Standard**. Each one has its own unique features and benefits, and they can be used to create all sorts of amazing digital assets, from cryptocurrencies to rare collectibles.

## Wrap up

By using the Flow token standards, developers can create tokens that are secure, reliable, and interoperable with other apps and services on the platform. And who knows? Your token might just be the next big thing in the blockchain world!

Get ready, because in the next lesson we're diving deep into the world of Fungible Token Standards! We'll explore how these standards work by checking out the coding part that defines the rules for creating Fungible Tokens on the Flow blockchain. It's going to be an awesome learning experience! ðŸŒŸ
