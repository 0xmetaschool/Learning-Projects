# What Are We Building Today

Gm everyone ☀️, today we are very excited to bring the fifth course of our detailed series about Sui blockchain for developers on Metaschool. Let’s start the fifth course by congratulating you for completing the first four courses on Sui. Woohoo!

So what are we building today? We will be building a loyalty smart contract using the Sui Move and then deploying it on the Sui blockchain. 

This loyalty smart contract will allow us to implement the loyalty program for our dex dApp. Loyalty programs help differentiate your dex dApp from others by giving unique rewards to the users such as NFTs.

Let’s look at how you will interact with the contract by the end of the course.
