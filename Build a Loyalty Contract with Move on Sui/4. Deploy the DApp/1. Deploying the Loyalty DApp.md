# Deploying the Loyalty DApp

Great job on writing your loyalty smart contract in the last section. In this section, let's deploy our contract. 

## Update `loyalty` contract `Move.toml` file

To successfully deploy your Dex Sui project, it is necessary to update the `Move.toml` file. This update is required to ensure that certain dependencies can be easily installed and used. During the implementation of the contracts, you may have noticed the use of some libraries. To install and use these libraries, please update the `Move.toml` file with the following information.

**Note:** Remember to use the same package name as you used while creating the Move on Sui project.

```
[package]
name = "loyalty"
version = "0.0.1"

[dependencies]
MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/move-stdlib", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }
Dex = { local = "../dex/contracts" }
DeepBook = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/deepbook", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }

[addresses]
loyalty = "0x0"
std = "0x1"
sui = "0x2"
deepbook = "0xdee9"
dex = "0xa1dce324bcf781692a358adb27bd105844231d35863b5c99f94e54801d653788"
```

Here, we use our Dex dApp and provide the local Dex app path. Therefore, you must have developed the Dex dApp in the last course of this Sui learning path. Please provide the local Dex dApp path here. Ensure that the Dex is deployed beforehand to use it in the loyalty app (if you have 100 Sui testnet tokens, or else you can use our contract). In our case, the path looked like the following.

```
Dex = { local = "/Users/username/Desktop/metaschool/Sui/dex-app/dex" }
```

At `[addresses]`, you must have noticed that we are using the dex contract address.  Use this address and don’t change it because this contract already has a pool created which costs 100 SUI tokens that you need to run the dex and loyalty dApp. If you have an a dex contract with the pool created, feel free to use it here.

Using the existing contract address will help loyalty dApp not publish the dex contract again but use the existing published address.

**Note:** Please use the updated versions of the packages and the same version as used in the dex dApp. Otherwise, loyalty dApp will give an error.

## Update `dex` contract `Move.toml` file

As you have noticed we are adding a local dex dApp path to our loyalty dApp, we need to update the dex `Move.toml` file to add the appropriate published address of the dex dApp. Otherwise, your loyalty will give you an error. Please use the following `Move.toml` file.

```
[package]
name = "Dex"
version = "0.0.1"
published-at = "0xa1dce324bcf781692a358adb27bd105844231d35863b5c99f94e54801d653788"

[dependencies]
MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/move-stdlib", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }
DeepBook = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/deepbook", rev = "testnet-v1.18.0" }

[addresses]
dex = "0xa1dce324bcf781692a358adb27bd105844231d35863b5c99f94e54801d653788"
std = "0x1"
sui = "0x2"
deepbook = "0xdee9"
```

We added the `published-at` address under the `[package]` field and a `dex` address under the `[addresses]` field. 

## **Build and publish loyalty dApp on Sui**

Follow the following steps to build and publish your Sui project on the blockchain.

### Step 1

Firstly, we must enter our `loyalty` directory since it contains our contracts.

```
cd loyalty
```

### Step 2

Now, let’s build our move file using the following command. This will create a new `build` folder and a `Move.toml` file. 

```
sui move build
```

Here’s what the output will look like.

### Step 3

You now need to set up a development environment in Sui to deploy on the Sui testnet using the following commands: 

```
sui client new-env --alias=testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env testnet
```

### Step 4

Run the following command to publish the Move project to the testnet finally:

```
sui client publish --skip-dependency-verification --gas-budget 90000000
```

We will have a long output but scroll to the start of the output and copy the Transaction Digest:

- **Note**: If you encounter an “Insufficient funds” error then you can head over to the [Sui Testnet faucet discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) and paste “!faucet [YOUR_ADDRESS]” to receive 10 SUI tokens.
    
    

### Step 5

Head over to [https://suiexplorer.com/?network=testnet](https://suiexplorer.com/?network=testnet). Paste the Transaction Digest in the search bar to find your transaction on the Sui Explorer:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you deployed a loyalty smart contract on the Sui blockchain. Good luck with your future deployments!

Next, let’s integrate the contract with frontend.
