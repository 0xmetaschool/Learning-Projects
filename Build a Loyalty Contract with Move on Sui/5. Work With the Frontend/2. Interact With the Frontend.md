# Interact With the Frontend

You have successfully set up everything for your front end. It's time to interact with dex and loyalty dApp simultaneously and see how it works.

## Interact with the frontend

Let's run our app by entering the following command in your terminal, located in the frontend directory, now that all credentials have been set up.

```
yarn dev
```

This time try again to log in by clicking on the “Sign with Google” button. Verify your Google account and then log in. After logging in wait for a few seconds for ZK to get connected with your app. After the request is completed, you will see a page like this.

Initially, you’ll see 0 balance in all or a few fields if you haven’t interacted with your dex dApp before. To use the loyalty dApp we must fill in the “DEX Swaps” and “DEXC Balance” fields. To fill these fields, we need to swap some tokens interchangeably.

Let’s play around with different features of our application and see how it works.

1. First, click on the “Mint SUI” button to increase your SUI balance.
2. To fill your USDC and ETH balance, click on the “Mint ETH” and “Mint USDC” buttons separately.
3. Before swapping, it is necessary to increase balances because, without any ETH or USDC, you will not be able to swap the tokens.
4. To swap the tokens, fill in the balance and click on the “Swap” button.
5. If you want to swap ETH to USDC or USDC to ETH tokens, click on the arrow button to switch their places.

### Swap ETH to USDC tokens

Here’s how we’re swapping the ETH tokens to USDC tokens.

After swapping the tokens, you’ll see the changes in the balance fields like the following.

## Head over to loyalty dApp

It is time to stake your DEXC tokens to earn rewards for using the Dex app. When you stake the DEXC tokens one time, you will start earning the reward for every 2nd token swap. When you collect 5 rewards, you will become eligible for a reward.

Head over to loyalty dApp by clicking on the Loyalty dApp button on the left top corner and stake or unstake your DEXC tokens.

After 5 rewards, you will be eligible to collect the reward. Let's see how it works. In our case, the reward will be an NFT.
