# Set Up the Frontend

Kudos! We have deployed our dApp. We are all set to proceed in setting up our front end. No more waiting, let’s go!

## Setting up the loyalty frontend

Open a new terminal in your `loyalty` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened.

Run the following command to clone the frontend directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/sui-loyalty-dapp-frontend.git
```

The front end will have the following file structure.

Let’s install our dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Find the loyalty package ID

Next, we need to find the package ID of our `loyalty` module, that we implemented while writing the contracts. Follow the following steps to do so.

1. Head over to the [Sui Explorer](https://suiexplorer.com/?network=testnet) and enter the Transaction Digest that you got in the last lesson in the search bar.

2. You can see the sidebar with the “Summary” heading. Please scroll to the end of the sidebar to find the “Publish” field.

3. Now, open the “Object” field by clicking on the “>” sign in the “Publish” field and click on the “loyalty” module.

You will see the page something like this:

1. Copy your package ID, as mentioned in the following screenshot. This will be your loyalty package ID that we will use in our front end.

## Set up the environment variables

Why do we even need a loyalty package ID? We need the ID to connect our Move project with the front end. Remember we discussed in the last lesson that to run the loyalty app we need a pool. So, head over to the `.env` file in your cloned front end, and fill in with your loyalty package ID.

```
LOYALTY_PACKAGE_ID=YOUR_LOYALTY_PACKAGE_ID
```

Also, we need the same environment variables we used for our dex app. As the loyalty app won’t work until you don’t sign in using Google, swap some ETH tokens to USDC tokens and USDC tokens to ETH tokens. So, either use the same `.env` file data here or copy-paste the following variables. We have also filled these variables in the `.env` file for your ease.

```
DEX_STORAGE_ID=0x6912d83e2c4868386511fe3f6f18aff9399b9ad5cae2d97943766e2ff160ab25
DEX_PACKAGE_ID=0xa1dce324bcf781692a358adb27bd105844231d35863b5c99f94e54801d653788
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID_GOOGLE=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
URL_ZK_PROVER=http://142.93.211.174:8001/v1
```

Do replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your Google client ID because it cannot be used by multiple users.

## Run the frontend

To run the frontend, run the following command in your terminal.

```
yarn dev
```

The command will give you an output like this:

Head over to the link, the `local` field is showing to you. You will see something like this in your browser.

## That’s a wrap

Phew, we’re so proud of you for setting up the front end yourself. Next, we will interact with the front end and see how does our dex and loyalty dApps work together.
