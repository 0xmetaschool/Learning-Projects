# The Battle Royale: Where NFTs Duke It Out

Welcome back, game masters! You've successfully laid the groundwork for your epic NFT battle arena. Now it's time to open the gates and welcome players into the fray! In this lesson, we'll focus on the initial steps of user registration and setting the stage for thrilling battles.

## Setting Up Your Right Branch

Run the following command to be at the `boilerplate02` branch:

```
git checkout boilerplate02
cd build-nft-card-game-on-core
```

Navigate to the `contracts/CardGameBattle.sol` and we’ll code there!

## Setting Up the Helper Functions

We need to add the functionality for player registration and battle preparation. But before that lets define a few helper functions so we can ease the code writing.

### isPlayer, getCharacterStats, and getRequiredExp

- `isPlayer`**:** Like checking if someone has a valid membership card to enter a club. This function determines if a given address belongs to a registered player.
- `getCharacterStats`**:** This function retrieves the character statistics for a specific player and token ID like checking a player's character sheet to see their current attributes.
- `getRequiredExp`**:** It calculates the required experience points to reach a specific level; similar to consulting a leveling chart in a game to determine the XP needed for the next rank.

### getBaseHealth, getBaseMana, getBaseAttack, getBaseDefense

These function retrieves the base values for health, mana, attack, and defense based on a character's class. Similar to looking up the base stats of a character in a role-playing game manual.

## The Grand Architect: Your Smart Contract

Imagine your smart contract as the blueprint for your game, the foundation upon which all the fun and excitement will be built. It's the rulebook, the referee, and the scorekeeper, all rolled into one. Let’s do it.

### registerPlayer

This function allows a new player to join the game. It checks if the player is already registered, then adds their name and address to the `players` mapping. Finally, it emits an event to notify other parts of the game that a new player has joined. Think of it like a person signing up for a new account on a gaming platform.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `64` with the correct variable name.

**Hint:** It’s the variable to store the name of the player.

![core c4 (14).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/2%20The%20Battle%20Royale%20Where%20NFTs%20Duke%20It%20Out/core_c4_(14).webp?raw=true)

### registerBattle

Imagine you're hosting a fighting tournament. `registerBattle` is like creating a new match. You give the match a name, assign the first player (you), and initialize the second player, character choices, and starting time. You then announce the match to everyone (emit the `BattleRegistered` event) and provide a unique ID for the match so others can join or watch.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `79` with the correct boolean value.

**Hint:** The battle is being registered and has not been started so can it be resolved?

![core c4 (15).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/2%20The%20Battle%20Royale%20Where%20NFTs%20Duke%20It%20Out/core_c4_(15).webp?raw=true)

### resolveBattle

The `resolveBattle` function is like the referee announcing the winner of a match. It verifies that the battle hasn't been decided yet, both players are valid, and they own the correct NFTs. It then checks the signature to ensure the result is legitimate. Finally, it updates the battle's status, player stats, and emits the result, similar to a referee declaring a winner and updating the scoreboard.

**Assignments**

1. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `106` with the correct variable.
    1. **Hint:** If there’s a single player, we need computer to play and if there are two, we need detail of the 2nd player. So do we have variable that checks if computer needs to intervene or not?
2. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `111` with the correct variable.
    1. **Hint:** Which `bytes32` variable did we define to store the hash?
3. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `118` with the correct boolean value.
    1. **Hint:** The battle is now registered and resolved so to what value should we update the `resolved` variable?

![core c4 (16).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/2%20The%20Battle%20Royale%20Where%20NFTs%20Duke%20It%20Out/core_c4_(16).webp?raw=true)

### _updateBattleStats

Imagine this function as a referee updating the scoreboard after a match. It determines who won and lost, awards points to the winner, and checks if either player has reached a new level.

`_updateBattleStats` updates the statistics of both players involved in a battle. It first determines the winner and loser, then updates their respective character stats. It increments the winner's experience, wins, and total experience, while incrementing the loser's experience and losses. Finally, it checks if either player has enough experience to level up and calls the `_levelUp` function for them.

**Assignments**

1. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `134` with the correct variable and arithmetic operation.
    1. **Hint:** So we had variable named `wins` and it should be increased now by 1.
2. Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `142` with the correct variable and arithmetic operation.
    1. **Hint:** See line `135` where we increased the total wins for the winner. Now we need to do the same for the player who lost. But variable name will be changed.

### _levelUp

This function is used to check if a character's experience points are sufficient to level up. It takes a `CharacterStats` struct as input and updates the character's level if they have enough experience.
