# Smart Contract Architecture

Welcome back, architects of the blockchain! In the previous lesson, we set up our development environment and set up the project repository. Now, it's time to roll up our sleeves and start enhancing this contract with the necessary data structures and function outlines to bring our NFT-powered battle game to life! 💪

## Start building the cardgame battle contract
First, let's make sure we're in the right place. Navigate to the `contracts/` directory within your project folder. You’ll find the `CardGameBattle.sol` file there. 

![core c4.jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4.jpg?raw=true)

This Solidity code defines a smart contract called `CardBattleGame`. It inherits from `Ownable` for ownership management and `EIP712` for standardized data signing. It interacts with an external NFT collection (`nftCollection`) and tracks battle IDs. The `CharacterClass` enum defines possible character types for the game. Think of it as creating a digital card game where players use NFTs as cards, and the contract manages battles and character types.

### Struct Players

Next, we have `Player` struct with fields for name, address, wins, losses, experience, and a mapping to store character statistics. It represents a player's profile in the card battle game.

This time, we have a few assignments for you. And believe me, you can do these very easily.

So let’s start with the first one. You need to replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `17` with the correct data type required for `name`.

**Hint:** Name will be a set of characters and we store those in what?? I know you can guess it, good luck! 🍀

### Character Stats ⚔️

Next, we need a way to represent the stats of each character (NFT) that players will use in battles. We have a `CharacterStats` struct that holds the core attributes of a character (NFT).

- `class`: Uses the `CharacterClass` enum to specify the character's type
- `level`: The character's current level.
- `exp`: The character's experience points, used for leveling up
- `health`, `mana`, `attack`, `defense`: Core stats that influence battle outcomes
- `wins` and `losses`: Track the character's individual win-loss record

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `30` with the correct data type required for `mana`.

**Hint**: Mana is the power and it can increase up to 10,000. So what should be the data type?

### Battles ⚔️

Let’s define `Battle` struct, which represents a battle between two players. It stores the following information. Think of it as a battle log where you record details about each match.

- `name`: A name or identifier for the battle.
- `player1` and `player2`: The Core blockchain addresses of the two players involved.ddd
- `player1TokenId` and `player2TokenId`: The IDs of the NFTs (characters) used by each player.
- `startTime`: The timestamp when the battle started
- `resolved`: A boolean flag indicating whether the battle has been concluded

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `38` with the correct keyword.

**Hint**: What’s the keyword to define the structure of Battle?

![core c4 (3).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4_(3).jpg?raw=true)

### Mappings

Next, we have defined the constants for EIP712 signatures, a counter for total battles, and mappings to store player and battle data using their addresses and IDs as keys.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `49` with the correct struct.

**Hint**: What’s the name of the struct we defined for Players?

![core c4 (5).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4_(5).jpg?raw=true)

### Events

Next, we have defined events that emit information about player registration, battle creation, and battle resolution, allowing other applications to track game activity.

**Assignment:** Replace YOUR_CODE_GOES_HERE in line `52` with the correct data type.

**Hint**: In which data type do we store the name? Remember we did something similar before too.

![core c4 (6).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4_(6).jpg?raw=true)

### Constructor

The constructor function initializes the contract with the NFT collection address, sets up EIP712, sets the owner, and initializes counters for tracking battles. It's like preparing the game board before starting a new match.

### Key Functions: Orchestrating the Action 🎭

Now, let's outline the essential functions that will drive the battle mechanics in our smart contract.

- **registerPlayer:** Registers a new player, updates the player's name and address, and emits a `PlayerRegistered` event.
- **registerBattle:** Creates a new battle, initializes its details, updates the total battle count, and emits a `BattleRegistered` event.
- **resolveBattle:** Resolves a battle, updates player and battle stats, emits a `BattleResolved` event, and verifies the signature using EIP712.
- **_updateBattleStats:** Updates the players' stats involved in a battle, including experience, wins, losses, and character levels.
- **_levelUp:** Checks if a character's experience is sufficient to level up and updates their level accordingly.

![core c4 (9).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4_(9).jpg?raw=true)

The `external` visibility modifier allows you to use the functions only outside the contract. Private allows you to use the functions only inside the contract.

### Helper functions

The helper functions provide various functionalities within the `CardBattleGame` contract:

- **isPlayer:** Checks if a given address is a registered player.
- **getBaseHealth, getBaseMana, getBaseAttack, getBaseDefense:** Returns the base values for health, mana, attack, and defense based on a character's class.
- **getCharacterStats:** Retrieves the character statistics for a specific player and token ID.
- **getRequiredExp:** Calculates the required experience points to reach a specific level.

Other functions within the contract will use these functions internally to provide core game mechanics and data retrieval.

![core c4 (8).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Battle%20Royale%20-%20core%20C4/2.%20Building%20the%20Battle%20Smart%20Contract/1.%20Smart%20Contract%20Architecture/core_c4_(8).jpg?raw=true)

Here, the `pure` keyword restricts the functions and does not allow the user to change any state variable of the contract nor read anything from the contract.

The `view` keyword only allows you to read from the contract but does not allow the user to modify the state of the contract.

## Compile and Check!

Let's make sure our contract is compiled without any errors. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Push your code

Now, as a best practice, lets push all our changes to git using the following command. These Git commands will add all your changes, create a commit with a descriptive message, and push your changes to the `boilerplate01` branch on your remote repository:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added the basic data structures and function declarations"
git push -u origin boilerplate01
```

## Wrapping Up & Gearing Up for Implementation 🚀

We've now laid the architectural foundation for our NFT battle game's smart contract! We have the data structures to represent players, characters, and battles, and we've outlined the key functions that will drive the core gameplay loop.

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into the implementation of these functions, bringing the battle logic to life on the blockchain. Get ready to code, strategize, and conquer!
