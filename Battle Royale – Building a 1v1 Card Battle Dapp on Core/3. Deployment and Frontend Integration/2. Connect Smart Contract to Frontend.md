# Connect Smart Contract to Frontend

Victory awaits, brave adventurers! We've forged the logic to determine battle outcomes in the previous lesson, and now it's time to connect the dots between our frontend dApp and the deployed battle contract on the blockchain.  This crucial link will allow us to tap into the contract's power and bring our game to life! ✨

Alright, now that we have prepared all the code, let’s see how all this looks in our application. 

## Pre-requisites

Make sure to complete our third course [Launching a 10K NFT collection on Core](https://metaschool.so/courses/launch-10k-nft-collection-on-core) of Core learning track. In the lesson, [Compiling and Deploying Contract](https://metaschool.so/courses/launch-10k-nft-collection-on-core/lesson/169dd4e0-1ee3-432e-84c7-6232bee99b16), you deployed the code and a deployed address for the smart contract was created. Make sure you have that. Additionally, we also need the ABI of the deployed smart contract, which can be found in the `backend/artifacts/contracts/CoreNFT.json` file.

## Prepare the Artifacts
Do the following steps:
1. Navigate to `/client/src/`.
2. Create `artifacts` folder.
3. Copy the `backend/artifacts/contracts/CoreNFT.json` to `/client/src/artifacts` folder.
4. Copy the `/artifacts/contracts/CardGameBattle.sol/CardBattleGame.json` file and paste it to `/client/src/artifacts`. Our application will use the ABIs contained in those `.json` file to interact with the respective contracts.

## Set Up Environment Variables

Now, in the `/client` directory, create a `.env` file and copy the following content. Against these variables:

1. Add the contract address of the `CardBattleGame` contract against `VITE_GAME_CONTRACT`
2. Your Metamask account private key against `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. Add the contract address of the `CoreNFT` contract from third course against `VITE_NFT_CONTRACT`.

```
VITE_GAME_CONTRACT=""
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=""
VITE_NFT_CONTRACT=""
```

## Install Dependencies and Run the App

And there you go, you are all set to run your frontend application! So navigate to the `/client` directory and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run your frontend application. You can access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

Connect your Metamask and with the new features in place, players can now:

- **View their NFT collection:** On the homepage, players will see a carousel showcasing their owned NFTs.
- **Select a card for battle:** They can interact with the carousel to choose the NFT they want to use in a battle.
- **Create or join battles:** The "Battle Arena" section now allows players to create new battles by providing a name. Additionally, they can see a list of available battles and join one by clicking the "Join Battle" button.

## That’s a Wrap

We've successfully bridged the gap between our frontend and the smart contract, enabling us to fetch and display crucial battle information. With this foundation in place, we're now ready to empower our players to select their cards and initiate epic battles! In the next lesson, we'll conclude our course.
