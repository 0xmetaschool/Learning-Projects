# Deploy to Core Testnet

Welcome back to another new lesson! Now that we are done with writing our smart contract, let’s deploy the contract on Core Testnet. Sounds interesting, right? Let’s get started!! 

## Compiling and Deploying the contract

Create a `.env` file in `build-nft-card-game-on-core` folder and add the following content to it. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your actual private key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

Let’s compile our contract using:

```
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploying the Contract

Now finally, let’s deploy the contract on Core Testnet. Before deploying, make sure you have added Core testnet to your Metamask wallet and have funded it with test tokens as mentioned in the previous lessons. 

Navigate to `backend/ignition/modules/deploy.js` and we have the deployment file there. 

You can now deploy using:

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network core_testnet
```

It will ask to confirm the deployment. Press `y`. Once it's deployed, you will see something like below. Copy your deployed address.

## Checking Transaction on Block Explorer

We can use Core Scan to check our transactions. To do that, let’s go to [this](https://scan.test.btcs.network/) link.

Once you are there, paste the address you received in the previous step in the search bar. You can now see that you have made the transaction:

## Verifying our Contract

To verify the contract, we first need to add our API Key from Core Scan to our `.env` file. Let’s see how we can do that:

- Go [here](https://scan.test.btcs.network/) and create your account
- Once your account is created, when you go to your profile, you will see an option API-KEYs.

- You can now click on `add` and create your API Key, we have named it `my_key`, but you can name it anything you want.

Once we have our key, let’s copy it and paste it into our `.env` file by assigning it to `API_KEY`

Our `.env` file now looks like this:

```
PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

We are now finally ready to verify our contract! We need to follow just one last step to verify our contract. To do that, you can simply follow the steps given below:

1. Replace YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS below with the deployed contract address you got during the last step. 

2. Complete our third course [Launching a 10K NFT collection on Core](https://metaschool.so/courses/launch-10k-nft-collection-on-core) of Core learning track. In the lesson, [Compiling and Deploying Contract](https://metaschool.so/courses/launch-10k-nft-collection-on-core/lesson/169dd4e0-1ee3-432e-84c7-6232bee99b16), you deployed the code and a deployed address for the smart contract was created. Replace NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with that.

```
npx hardhat verify --network core_testnet YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

Once it's verified, you will see something like below:

## Pushing it to Git

Now, as a best practice, let's push all our changes to git using the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Smart contract coded completely"
git push -u origin boilerplate02
```

## Wrap Up

Congratulations!! You have achieved a lot in this lesson! From compiling the contract to deploying it and even verifying your contract. You have done it all! You have even checked your transaction on Core Scan. Well done! In the next lesson, we will interact with the frontend. See you there!
