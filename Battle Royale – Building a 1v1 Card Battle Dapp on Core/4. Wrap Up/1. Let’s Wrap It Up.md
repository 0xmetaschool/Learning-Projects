# Let’s Wrap It Up

Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate your incredible journey! It's time to take a moment and reflect on everything you've learned in this course. Let's summarize what you've learned till now.

## Building Battle Royale game

One of the most interesting parts of the course was that we learnt how to transform your static NFTs into dynamic gaming assets, create an engaging battle system, and build a user-friendly interface that will captivate players.

## Deploy and Interact with Contract

Another super interesting part filled with learning, was when we deployed our contract on Core and interacted with it through frontend. And that’s how we built a full-fledged project which not only creates a contract but also interacts with it through our frontend.
