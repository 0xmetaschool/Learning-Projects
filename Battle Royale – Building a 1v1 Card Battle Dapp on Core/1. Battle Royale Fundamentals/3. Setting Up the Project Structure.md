3. Fetch some tokens from the [Core testnet faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet) by entering your wallet address to receive 1 CORE.

## Setting Up Your Project

We will first fork and clone the "build-nft-card-game-on-core" repo. Run the following command to setup the project. We have made a basic HardHat project for you with the empty files. Youâ€™ll have to implement the code in those files.

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/0xmetaschool/build-nft-card-game-on-core.git --clone
cd build-nft-card-game-on-core
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `build-nft-card-game-on-core` folder and add the following content to it. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your actual private key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

## Thatâ€™s a Wrap!

Congratulations! You've successfully set up your development environment and are ready to embark on the exciting journey of building your own NFT card battle game on the Core blockchain. In the next lesson, weâ€™ll delve into the specifics of smart contract development and begin crafting the logic that will power your game. Get ready to level up your game dev skills and create something truly epic!
