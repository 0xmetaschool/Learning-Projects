# Environment Setup

Let's get to the most important part which is setting up the Rust environment.

Please follow the steps carefully.

If you are on Mac, please scroll down the follow that. If you are on Linux, set up is the same as Windows but you don‚Äôt need WSL.

## For Windows

You need to install Linux Subsystem for Windows as this development needs Linux kernel.

So if you have a Linux or Mac environment it's great, but if you have a Windows environment we need to setup up Linux on it.

You could either install Linux on your system as dual boot or use virtualization tools like Vmware or Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

For this course, I will go with WSL.

- Start by running your Windows terminal in administrator mode
- In your CMD or Powershell run the following command

```
wsl --install
```

Note: If you have already installed WSL, update the WSL using `wsl --update`

It will take some time to install as it will install an Ubuntu distort of Linux on your Windows.

- Restart your computer, after your installation is complete
- After restarting your computer, an Ubuntu shell will popup automatically installing some required feature. If it doesn‚Äôt popup after restarting your computer, open Ubuntu on Windows from start menu

The Ubuntu terminal will now ask for the unix username as shown here.

- Now enter a username and press enter, then it will prompt you to enter a password
- Enter a password and note whenever you enter a password in any Linux terminal, no feedback (like any bullets) when entering a character, just keep typing your password and then press enter

After your Ubuntu setup is complete, your terminal will show up like this.

Now‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs move forward and install Rust toolchain on WSL

- First, download the latest updates for your Ubuntu distribution by running the following command.

```
sudo apt update
```

Note: Sudo will allow the terminal to run in administrator mode on any Linux distort and whenever you use sudo, you need to type your password. Again, no feedback will be shown as usual so keep entering your password and press enter

- Add the required package for our Ubuntu distribution by running the following command.

```
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
```

Note: If a prompt comes up for allowing the installation of package, enter yes or y to continue

After that let‚Äôs curl Rustup installation program.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the instructions and proceed with the default installation

Note: These installations take up some space so keep at least 50 GB free in your Windows Drive

Now update your current shell with cargo environment by running the following command.

```
source ~/.cargo/env
```

If you have Rust installed in your environment, check the installed version using the following command.

```
rustc --version
```

Configure the rustup to use the latest stable version of the toolchain by running the following command.

```
rustup default stable
rustup update
```

Add the nightly version of the toolchain and the nightly WebAssembly (WASM) target to the development environment by running the following command.

```
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Now, we have almost finished setting up the environment. Let‚Äôs check our toolchain specs and if we have installed everything correctly ‚ö°Ô∏è

```
rustup show
rustup +nightly show
```

As you can see, we have installed everything perfectly so we are good to go forward!

If you are using a Mac or Linux, you can skip setting up the Linux environment as both of these support UNIX terminals by default.

If you're using Windows, you can skip the next part about Mac and move to the next lesson. üíª

## For MAC

Start by installing homebrew

Open terminal and run the following command.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Verify your installation by running.

```
brew --version
```

If you are using an M1 Mac or any ARM processor, you must have Rosetta installed to run protoc tools. Install Rosetta by running the following command in your terminal.

```
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

Install OpenSSL and rust toolchain for Mac. We need to install openSSL to provide support for cryptography which a blockchain needs. Run the following command to install it.

```
brew install openssl
```

Let‚Äôs download the rustup installation program.

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the installation instructions and proceed with the default installation.

Now go ahead and update your current shell with cargo environment by running the following command üëáüèº

```
source ~/.cargo/env
```

If you have Rust installed in your environment, check the installed version using the following command.

```
rustc --version
```

Configure the rustup to use the latest stable version of the toolchain by running the following command.

```
rustup default stable
rustup update
```

Add the nightly version of the toolchain and the nightly WebAssembly (WASM) target to the development environment by running the following command.

```
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

Now, we have almost finished setting up the environment. Let‚Äôs check our toolchain specs and if we have installed everything correctly,

```
rustup show
rustup +nightly show
```

So this was the whole process for all you frens using mac or linux. You don‚Äôt need any special instructions, it‚Äôs pretty simple - just follow the Windows one if you don‚Äôt need to set up any environment.

Let‚Äôs move on to the next lesson and where we will start building our blockchain. ‚ú®
