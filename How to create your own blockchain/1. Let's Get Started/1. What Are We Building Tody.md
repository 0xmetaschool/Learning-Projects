# What Are we Building Today

gm everyone 🌞, I’m very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial about building the blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we are going to launch a blockchain using Substrate. It's going to be so much fun because not many platforms (or any) have attempted to teach how to launch a blockchain.

But but but… will not only be building a blockchain, rather we'll simultaneously dive deep into blockchain concepts as well.

I cannot put more emphasis on how important this course is for your career as a web3 engineer, so study and study closely.

## Course overview

We will cover:

- Using Substrate SDK
- Polkadot environment and Layer-0 protocol
- Key blockchain concepts and working principles
- What is relay chain
- What are parachains
- How to run your substrate based blockchain locally

**Keep your momentum going! In lesson 3rd and 4th, we’ll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can’t wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about building their own blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain ecosystem and [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/) because in this course we will focus more on building your own blockchain and skip the theory part.

## Prerequisites

- A good Internet connection and access to your CLI.
- Basic understanding of [how to use Linux terminal](https://hackr.io/blog/basic-linux-commands).
- Rust Environment (walkthrough in the upcoming lessons).

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
