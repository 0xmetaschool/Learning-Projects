# Into the World of Substrate

Great decision on continuing to learning with us and increasing your knowledge. Let‚Äôs move forward and start our fun ride.

## So, what is Substrate?

It's the main blockchain SDK (software development kit) used by programmers to build the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.

Polkadot is a Layer-0 protocol, built by Ethereum‚Äôs co-founder Gavin Wood citing Ethereum‚Äôs inability to scale. Wood wanted to solve this problem by introducing a proof-of-stake (POS) validation system since PoS consensus is used by most modern blockchains.

Polkadot makes the development of a Layer-1 blockchain easier by providing a built-in infrastructure for developers to build upon.

Now let‚Äôs understand,

## Why do we need Substrate?

Blockchain development is a very complex and resource consuming task. It involves many sophisticated technologies including advanced cryptography and distributed computing. The development also involves a lot of problem statements like scalability, interoperability, upgradability, etc.

So, substrate is an SDK that provide that framework to build a blockchain, so rather than focusing on developing a framework from scratch like the application layer, network layer, RPC, etc, you could focus on developing the business logic or its runtime logic.

## Substrate has the following advantages

- It's an open source SDK so you can customize your blockchain according to your needs. Plus they have a very strong builder community to help you with the development.
- The blockchain created using substrate are highly interoperable as it can communicate with other substrate blockchains using Cross Consensus Messaging or XCM.
- Substrate frameworks are upgradable and composable as the state transition logic of the blockchain or the runtime is stored as a WebAssembly object which gives the blockchain nodes the ability to perform ‚Äúforkless‚Äù upgrades.

Hope I could help you understand the basics of Substrate and why we should use it.

Let‚Äôs move to the next lesson where we will setup the environment to run the Substrate template node locally. üî•
