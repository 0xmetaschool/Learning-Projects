# Setting Up the Environment

Welcome back, folks! So we learned the importance of building this Horoscope project. Kudos! In this lesson, we will set up the environment required to build our project.

So get ready to set up the project and install all the dependencies. Brace yourself and fire up your terminal. We will be running a handful of commands.

## Why Hardhat?

Blockchain is like a public database and our smart contracts live on that database. This database is publicly available and accessible. Based on our contractâ€™s configuration, anyone or only specific people can play around with our contract. Every time we publish a contract on the blockchain, it gets an address - a digital footprint for us to track it. Weâ€™ll build everything for the Ethereum Blockchain and also will use Solidity and other libraries for this project.

Publishing a contract directly on blockchain for learning purposes will be an expensive deal. Every time we create a new contract, edit the contract, or publish it on the blockchain, we incur some cost in the form of ETH, or MATIC. In order to avoid that and test the contracts properly, we will create a test environment that pretty much replicates the production environment, is free to use, and is easy to access.

For this purpose, we will use  [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/). Hardhat gives you a local Ethereum network designed for rapid development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests, and debug your code without spending a dime. How cool is that?

### Install HardHat

First, make a project directory where you will work and we will install all the dependencies and hardhat there.

Now open your terminal and run the following commands one by one. Just copy and paste one by one.

```
mkdir HoroscopeNFT
cd HoroscopeNFT
npm install --save-dev hardhat@2.20.0
```

The above commands mean that you created a `HoroscopeNFT` folder - an empty one. You entered that folder and initialized the project by making a `package.json` file. Then you installed hardhat in the same folder.

If you have followed the instructions properly, and everything went according to the plan, you have HardHat installed.

Now write the following command on the terminal.

```
npx hardhat init
```
Create a JavaScript project. Just follow through the questions and answer them yes. For me, it was something like this:

We will also install a smart contracts library called OpenZeppelin. It will make it easy for us to develop, run, and ship smart contracts.

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## That's a wrap

And if all that is done, congrats, you have a smart contract ready to go. Yasss!! ðŸš€ A basic sample JavaScript project is created for you and in the next lesson you will execute your first-ever smart contract.
