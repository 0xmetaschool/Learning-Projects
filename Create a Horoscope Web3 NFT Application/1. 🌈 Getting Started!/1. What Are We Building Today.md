# What Are We Building Today

Heya folks! Today we will be helping you create your first ever Web3 application and ship it too.

So what are we building today? We will be building a very cool and exciting project. We will create a react app that takes a users‚Äô date of birth, connects their Metamask wallet and then mint an NFT to their address.

Let‚Äôs see at how it will look like by the end of the course.

**Why this project?** This will be a pure example of how an application can interact with a deployed contract. Using this, you can create some engaging apps too. For example:

1. A Harry Potter quiz app that tells you which Hogwartz House you belong to?
2. A quiz app to see if you are BTS Army or not? (We love BTS!! üî•)
3. The famous 13 personality test

For you the sky is the limit. Once you have created this react app, you can come up with unique and fun app ideas, launch them and get users to try your app. This is gonna be so cool and we are already excited to see what dope projects you create.

Not only this, there is much more fun stuff we will be doing during this project. So be excited and please bring your A game here.
