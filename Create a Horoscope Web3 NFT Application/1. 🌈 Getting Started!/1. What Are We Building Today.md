# What Are We Building Today

Heya folks! Today I will be helping you create your first ever Web3 application and ship it too.

So what are we building today? We will be building a very cool and exciting project. We will create a react app that takes a users’ date of birth, connects their Metamask wallet and then mint an NFT to their address.

Let’s see at how it will look like by the end of the course.

**Why this project?** This will be a pure example of how an application can interact with a deployed contract. Using this, you can create some engaging apps too. For example:

1. A Harry Potter quiz app that tells you which Hogwartz House you belong to?
2. A quiz app to see if you are BTS Army or not? (I love BTS!! 🔥)
3. The famous 13 personality test

For you the sky is the limit. Once you have created this react app, you can come up with unique and fun app ideas, launch them and get users to try your app. This is gonna be so cool and I am already excited to see what dope projects you create.

Not only this, there is much more fun stuff we will be doing during this project. So be excited and please bring your A game here.

## Course overview

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about building an app in web3. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, Solidity Programming language, and a little bit knowledge of front-end as in this course we will focus more on building.

## Prerequisites

- Install [node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Download [VScode from here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Metamask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))

> **Note:** Please refer to [this course](https://metaschool.so/courses/understand-and-setup-metamask-account) to setup your MetaMask if you still hasn’t. Come back to this course after you have set it up.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
