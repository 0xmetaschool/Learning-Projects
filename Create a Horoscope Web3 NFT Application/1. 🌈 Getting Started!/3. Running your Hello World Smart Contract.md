# Running your Hello World Smart Contract

Greetings! So you are all set up and ready to run smart contracts. So let’s dive right into it!

## Project structure

Let’s open your project in VSCode Sublime or any other IDE you prefer. The structure will look something like this. I personally and millions of other devs prefer VSCode. You can even install a Solidity extension there.

## Update config file

Before moving on, let’s update the Solidity version in the config file. We are updating the version because the OpenZepplin library works with the updated Solidity version. So go to the `hardhat.config.js` and change the Solidity version to `“0.8.20"`. Here’s what my config file looks like.

## Running your Hello World smart contract

If you look at `contracts/Lock.sol`, you will see an existing solidity file that has a contract in it. Let’s try to run it using the following command in the terminal where you still are in your project directory in your terminal.
first paste below code to your project directory scripts folder(if not exist use `mkdir scripts` to create it) deploy.js file

```js
const {
  time,
} = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
  const ONE_GWEI = 1_000_000_000;

  const lockedAmount = ONE_GWEI;
  const unlockTime = (await time.latest()) + ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS;

  const Lock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

  await lock.waitForDeployment()
  console.log(`Lock with ${ONE_GWEI} and unlock timestamp ${unlockTime} deployed to ${await lock.getAddress()}`);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  );
```

then run below command

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

You will see something like this on your terminal.

This was deployed successfully because of the file `scripts/deploy.js` that contain the code to deploy your smart contract.

Well congratulations, you’ve been successful in deploying your first smart contract to your local blockchain environment without having to code a single line.

### Explanation

So what’s happened? Let’s try to understand it.

When you run the above command, your solidity code is converted into bytecode. A new local blockchain is created and your contract is deployed there. But this blockchain is not permanent, every time you build and run your smart contract, a new blockchain is created in your local environment and the contract is deployed.

So it is more like a clean slate - start from scratch. We will get back to it later and figure out a way to deploy our contract permanently. For now, just a piece of information for you to digest.

Also, the above long line of numbers is the address where your contract is deployed. Every contract has its own address. Because of hardhat, we were able to create a local blockchain environment just like Ethereum where we can deploy contracts and play around with them free of cost.

## Let’s write another smart contract

Let’s now write our own code instead of an existing one, so we can understand how we can write code in Solidity.

Just go to the `contracts` folder and create a new file named `Greeter.sol`.

What will this file actually do? We will build a smart contract named "Greeter" with a constructor to initialize a greeting message. 

Our greeter file will have three parts:

1. A constructor where we can pass a string type variable called `_greeting`.
2. A function `greet()` which returns the greeting value. It is a read-only function. It just returns the current value of the greeting variable.
3. A function `setGreeting()` where we can set the value of the greeting message. After deploying the contract, we can call this function to change the value of the greeting.

### Code

Let's start coding.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
```

- This is a special comment that specifies the license under which the code is released. In this case, it indicates that the code is released without any license restrictions (Unlicense).

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```

- This specifies the version of the Solidity programming language required to compile the contract. The caret (`^`) symbol means that the contract is compatible with any version that starts with `0.8.20` but not with version `0.9.0` or above.

**Note:** If the IDE shows a red line below this line, ignore it, as it won’t cause an error when we run the code.

```
import "hardhat/console.sol";
```

- This line imports the `console.sol` library from the Hardhat development environment. The `console` library provides functions for printing debug information to the console during contract execution.

```
contract Greeter {
```

- This begins the declaration of a new Solidity contract named 'Greeter'.

```
string private greeting;
```

- This declares a private string variable named `greeting`. The `private` visibility modifier means that this variable can only be accessed from within the contract itself, not from external contracts or accounts.

```
constructor(string memory _greeting) {
```

- This is the constructor function of the contract, which gets executed only once during contract deployment.
- It takes a string parameter `_greeting`, which is used to set the initial value of the `greeting` variable.

```
console.log("Deploying a Greeter with greeting:", _greeting);
```

- This logs a message to the console during contract deployment, indicating the value of the `_greeting` parameter.

```
greeting = _greeting;
```

- This assigns the value of the `_greeting` parameter to the `greeting` variable, effectively setting the initial greeting message.

```
function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
```

- This declares a public view function named `greet`.
- The `public` modifier means that this function can be called from both inside and outside the contract.
- The `view` modifier means that this function does not modify the contract state and only reads data (it doesn't modify any variables).

```
return greeting;
```

- This statement returns the current value of the `greeting` variable to the caller of the `greet` function.

```
function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
```

- This declares a public function named `setGreeting`.
- The `public` modifier means that this function can be called from both inside and outside the contract.

```
console.log("Changing greeting from '%s' to '%s'", greeting, _greeting);
```

- This logs a message to the console, indicating the current value of the `greeting` variable and the new value provided as the `_greeting` parameter.

```
greeting = _greeting;
```

- This assigns the value of the `_greeting` parameter to the `greeting` variable, effectively changing the greeting message.

### Complete code

```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Greeter {
    string private greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        console.log("Deploying a Greeter with greeting:", _greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        console.log("Changing greeting from '%s' to '%s'", greeting, _greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

## Deploy the contract

We have deployment scripts in the `scripts` folder. Hardhat always runs the compile task when running scripts with its command line interface. If this script is run directly using `node` you may want to call compile manually to make sure everything is compiled.

Let’s edit the `scripts/deploy.js` file with the following code:

```
// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through 'node <script>'.
// When running the script with 'npx hardhat run <script>' you'll find the Hardhat
// Runtime Environment's members are available in the global scope.
const {ethers} = require("hardhat");
 
async function main() {
  const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
  const greeter = await Greeter.deploy("Hello, Hardhat!");
 
  await greeter.waitForDeployment();
 
  console.log("Greeter deployed to:", await greeter.getAddress());
}
 
// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

### Explanation

The code is a JavaScript script that uses Hardhat to deploy the `Greeter` smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain. It sets up a deployment function named `main`, asynchronously deploys the contract with a greeting message, waits for the deployment to complete, and then logs the contract's address to the console. The recommended error handling ensures that any errors during deployment are properly handled and displayed.

### Command to deploy

Run the following command in the terminal:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

You will see something like this on your terminal.

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, you learned how to get started with writing and deploying smart contracts using Solidity and Hardhat. You learned how to set up your project and run your first contract, as well as how to write your own smart contracts from scratch. You also learned how to deploy your contracts to a local blockchain environment and test them out.

In the next lesson, we will write an NFT contract.
