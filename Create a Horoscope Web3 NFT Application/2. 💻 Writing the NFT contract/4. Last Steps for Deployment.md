# Last Steps for Deployment

Greetings! So did a great job in setting the testnet. Letâ€™s finally deploy our NFT on it now!

## Last steps for deployment

First, letâ€™s do some basic housekeeping stuff. We know that there are massive scams and security issues happening in the crypto world. You make a mistake and it can cost you a lifetime.

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Letâ€™s do the following.

```
npm install dotenv --save
```

ðŸ”¥ This is super important! ðŸ”¥

We have created a `.env` file. Open your `.gitignore` file and write `.env` there.  [Here is a sample .env file that you can replicate.](https://github.com/Metaschoolso/Learning-Projects/blob/main/.env-sample) 

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in a `.env` file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the `.gitignore` file we simply write `.env`, and it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

We will update our hardhat config file.

## Updating Hardhat Config file

Open your `hardhat.config.js` file and paste the following code.

```
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();
const {PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
module.exports = {
   solidity: "0.8.20",
   defaultNetwork: "amoy",
   networks: {
     hardhat: {},
     amoy: {
       url: "https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_amoy",
       accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
     },
   },
};
```

## Deployment

Now you are ready to deploy your contract to the Polygon network. The command is the same as before. Wait a second. We need to update our `scripts/deploy.js` file too with the following code.

```
async function main() {
  const Horoscope = await ethers.deployContract("contracts/horoscopeNFT.sol:horoscopeNFT");
  const horoscope = await Horoscope.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Deploying Contract...")
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:",  await horoscope.getAddress());
}
// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

This is what we are doing in our deployment script. By using the HardHat ethers plugin, we create an instance of our contract and deploy it.

```
	const Horoscope = await ethers.getContractFactory("contracts/horoscopeNFT.sol:horoscopeNFT");
  console.log("Deploying Contract...")
  const horoscope = await Horoscope.deploy();
```

Letâ€™s run the command in our terminal and run this project.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Once your contract is deployed, you can see an output similar to below:

## Interact with your contract

Copy your contract address and scan it on [**https://amoy.polygonscan.com/**](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/). And this is how it looks:

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

Phew!!! We are 80% done. You should be proud of yourself. You started from scratch and now you have your own collection of NFT minted on testnet. I think you should talk about it on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord. In short anywhere you can humble brag a bit and tell people that you are doing amazing stuff on Web3.

While you are at it, donâ€™t forget to mention  [@0xmetaschool](https://twitter.com/0xmetaschool)  on Twitter. We need your support to reach more devs.

In the next lesson, we will be building the front end of our app.
