# Writing and Deploying Basic NFT Contract

Welcome back! So by now, you have built up enough knowledge to get started with a core part of the project. We will be writing and understanding the NFT contract in this lesson.

## Writing the NFT contract

So first of all, in the `contracts` folder, create a new file named `horoscopeNFT.sol`. 

This is your new contract file. We will write a detailed NFT contract and for that, we will use  [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/). Remember you installed it while setting up your workspace.

- **OpenZeppelin** is a reusable and secure smart contracts library, which means that you can import this library, inherit the contracts in your project, and get started without having to worry about security issues and reinventing the wheel. I’d recommend you to check out their official website, read stuff, and get to know more.

For minting NFTs, we will create a basic contract based on ERC721 - the non-fungible token standard. OpenZeppelin gives us the base ERC721 with all the important functionalities. You can read more about this contract and all functions encapsulated in that contract [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721). And while you are at it, read all the functions and capabilities that come packaged in this magical library [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721).

## Complete code

The complete code for NFT is as follows:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract horoscopeNFT is ERC721URIStorage {
    uint256 private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("Horoscope", "HSCP") {}

    function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory zodiacSign)
        public
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds;
        _safeMint(recipient, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, zodiacSign);
        _tokenIds += 1;
        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

Now let me explain the code step by step 😁

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
```

- This is the version of Solidity we are using in our contract. Ignore any red line you might see below this line.

```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "hardhat/console.sol";
```

- Here we are importing `ERC721URIStorage` contract, this contract contains ERC721 contracts. The metadata part of the NFT contract needs to be stored somewhere, so we are using an extension of the base ERC721 contract which can have URI storage.

```
contract horoscopeNFT is ERC721URIStorage {
    uint256 private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721("Horoscope", "HSCP") {}

```

- Here we are creating a contract called `horoscopeNFT` and inheriting `ERC721URIStorage`.
- Then we create a private `_tokenIds` counter with a default value of `0`. By making it private, no one outside the contract can call it.
- The constructor is the first function that is called when we deploy our contract and all we are doing is specifying ERC721 and giving it the name Horoscope and symbol HSCP. This name will be reflected in Opensea, Rarible, and Etherscan - both the names and symbols. So Horoscope is the name of our NFT collection and HSCP is the symbol. This constructor function `ERC721` is coming from `ERC721URIStorage`. It is not visible here because it is inside this file.

```
function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory zodiacSign)
        public
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds;
        _safeMint(recipient, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, zodiacSign);
        _tokenIds += 1;
        return newItemId;
    }
```

- This is the public function where we will pass the address of the person who is minting the NFT and their zodiac sign. Once the contract is deployed, anyone can call this function.
- Unlike the constructor, this function is not called when the contract is deployed but is called on demand. I have kept it very simple. The function first increments the token number, then mints the NFT to recipient address and passes the current NFT number.
- In the `setTokenURI`, it saves the NFT number along with the NFT data. In the NFT data, I am merely passing a string `zodiacSign` but this is where we will be passing on all the metadata related to our NFT.

## Deploying the NFT contract locally

Now let’s update our script file `deploy.js` in the `scripts` folder with the following code: 

```
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  console.log("Deploying Contract...");
  const horoscope = await hre.ethers.deployContract(
    "contracts/horoscopeNFT.sol:horoscopeNFT"
  );
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", horoscope.target);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now let’s run our contract and see how it goes.

```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

- When you deploy your contract, you might see a warning related to the ‘zodiac sign’ parameter being unused, let’s ignore that for now. We will get to it laterrrrr.
    
    

This is how the output will look like:

Remember, here we deployed the contract locally and not on any network. We will deploy the contract on testnet in upcoming lessons.

## That’s a wrap

Boom! Your `horoscopeNFT` contract is deployed to the local chain. Now we will move to the testnet and add real images to our NFT too.
