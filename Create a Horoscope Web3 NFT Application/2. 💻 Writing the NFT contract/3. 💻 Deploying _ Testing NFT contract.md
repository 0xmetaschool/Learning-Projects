# 💻 Writing the NFT contract

## **💻 Deploying & Testing NFT contract**

As NFTschool, describes it.

"There are three environments for a blockchain network: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.

### devnet

Till now we were using the local development network to run our smart contracts. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started, iterate and run things without having to setup tons of stuff. For setting up devnet, we used Hardhat that provided us a local ethereum like blockchain environment. Remember at the start of this project, I mentioned, how every time we deploy a smart contract it is a start from scratch. Now we are being promoted. Since we have setup a basic contract which we believe can run. We will use a testnet environment.

### testnet

Because devnets are a simplified simulation of the real network, they don’t always behave in quite the same way. This is a good thing when you want fast development cycles, but not so great when you want to know how your contract will actually work on mainnet.

For that, you can deploy and run your contract on a test network, or  _testnet_. These networks generally run the same code as the mainnet, but they have separate blockchain states and may be configured differently in various ways.

### mainnet

The  _mainnet_  is the official production network. It is considered the source of truth, and its tokens can be exchanged for “real world” money in various ways. As you might imagine, using the mainnet for development and testing is an expensive proposition."

### Setting up the testnet environment
#### Note: Rinkeby won't be maintained moving forward. Follow the same steps to set up Goerli network.
We will do the following things.

-   Add Rinkeby network to metamask
-   Get some fake ETH for the transaction
-   Create a Staging Rinkeby Network app on Alchemy
-   Update our hardhat.config.js file to include the rinkeby network.

#### Changing your network on MetaMask

We will not be using the live/production environment at the moment because it will be expensive to deploy a contract. You will need some real ETH to do that! And of course, learning and deploying contracts on production for the purpose of learning is not sustainable.

We will switch to Rinkeby Network, it is a test network which pretty much is a simulation of ethereum blockchain production. Just open chrome and switch your network to Rinkeby, if you are not able to see it.

Here are the steps to turn on test networks

1.  Go to settings
2.  Open Advanced
3.  Scroll down to Show Test Networks
4.  Turn on

#### Get some fake ETH $$ 🤑

Try the following websites and try to get some fake ETHs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can’t buy NFTs, or other assets via these ETH.

All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the ETH will be transferred.

1.  [https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)
2.  [https://rinkeby-faucet.com/](https://rinkeby-faucet.com/)  
    

#### Get your private 🦊 MetaMask key

Open the metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export private it and paste it somewhere secure. DON’T COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON’T SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

Your API key and HTTP address is important, save it somewhere for now, and we will use it in our project later.
