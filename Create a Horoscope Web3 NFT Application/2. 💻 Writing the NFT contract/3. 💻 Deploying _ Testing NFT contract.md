# üíª Writing the NFT contract
## üíª Deploying & Testing NFT contract

As NFTschool, describes it.

"There are three environments for a blockchain network: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.

## devnet
Till now we were using the local development network to run our smart contracts. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started, iterate and run things without having to setup tons of stuff. For setting up devnet, we used Hardhat that provided us a local ethereum like blockchain environment. Remember at the start of this project, I mentioned, how every time we deploy a smart contract it is a start from scratch. Now we are being promoted. Since we have setup a basic contract which we believe can run. We will use a testnet environment.

## testnet
Because devnets are a simplified simulation of the real network, they don‚Äôt always behave in quite the same way. This is a good thing when you want fast development cycles, but not so great when you want to know how your contract will actually work on mainnet.

For that, you can deploy and run your contract on a test network, or  _testnet_. These networks generally run the same code as the mainnet, but they have separate blockchain states and may be configured differently in various ways.

## mainnet
The  _mainnet_  is the official production network. It is considered the source of truth, and its tokens can be exchanged for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù money in various ways. As you might imagine, using the mainnet for development and testing is an expensive proposition."

## Setting up the testnet environment
We will do the following things.
-   Add Sepolia network to Metamask
-   Get some fake ETH for the transaction
-   Update our hardhat.config.js file to include the Sepolia network.

Now we need to setup our metamask with the Sepolia RPC so let's go get that,

## First, What is a RPC?
So RPC is like a communication to blockchain which allows you to read/write on the blockchain, in short, a RPC is like a communication gateway for any blockchain

I hope that's clear for you so let's go and add this RPC to our metamask.

Let's go to [Metaschool RPC for Sepolia](https://metaschool.so/rpc/sepolia)

Click on "add to metamask" and confirm the transaction and that's it SEPOLIA is added to your metamask

So, we have finished setting up metamask for our token, now let‚Äôs get some free ETH tokens to pay for the transaction fees.

## Let‚Äôs get some FREE ETH Tokensü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë

We will be using Testnet environment to create our own tokens.

For every transaction on blockchain, we need a native token of that blockchain, since we are building on Ethereum chain, we will need ETH tokens. So let‚Äôs get some fake money.

- Now go to¬†[https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
- Sign in with your metamask wallet
- Now you will see an option to request LINK token and ETH token on Sepolia network, Make sure to select ETH token out of the two
- After this login with your Twitter to verify yourself
- Finally you need to complete the Captcha and click on send request

## Get your private ü¶ä MetaMask key

Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export private it and paste it somewhere secure. DON‚ÄôT COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON‚ÄôT SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!
