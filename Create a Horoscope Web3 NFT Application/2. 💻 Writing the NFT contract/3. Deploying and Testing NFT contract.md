# Deploying and Testing NFT contract

As NFTschool, describes it: “There are three environments for a blockchain network: mainnet, devnet, and testnet.”

### devnet

Till now we were using the local development network to run our smart contracts. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started, iterate and run things without having to setup tons of stuff. For setting up devnet, we used Hardhat that provided us a local ethereum like blockchain environment. Remember at the start of this project, I mentioned, how every time we deploy a smart contract it is a start from scratch. Now we are being promoted. Since we have setup a basic contract which we believe can run. We will use a testnet environment.

### testnet

Because devnets are a simplified simulation of the real network, they don’t always behave in quite the same way. This is a good thing when you want fast development cycles, but not so great when you want to know how your contract will actually work on mainnet.

For that, you can deploy and run your contract on a test network, or  *testnet*. These networks generally run the same code as the mainnet, but they have separate blockchain states and may be configured differently in various ways.

### mainnet

The  *mainnet*  is the official production network. It is considered the source of truth, and its tokens can be exchanged for “real world” money in various ways. As you might imagine, using the mainnet for development and testing is an expensive proposition."

### Setting up the testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/80001](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001).
- Click on “Connect Wallet”.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on “Add to Metamask”.
- Click on Approve and then Switch network.

You will be successfully connected to Mumbai network. See in the following gif how I did it:

### Get some fake MATIC $$ 🤑

Now its time to get some money! 

- Copy your account address.
- Head over to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
- Paste your wallet address.

See in the following gif how I did it:

This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can’t buy NFTs, or other assets via these MATIC.

## Get your private 🦊 MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Complete the following steps to find your private key:

- Open the Metamask extension.
- Click on your Account.
- Click on 3 dots and then Account Details.
- Click on Show private key.
- Enter your password and hit Confirm.
- Copy your private key.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next lesson. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. DON’T COMMIT IT ON GITHUB, DONT SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON’T SHARE IT ANYWHERE! IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

## Create `.env` file

Now create `.env` file in your folder of `HoroscopeNFT`and paste following in to the file. Yes. Your file name would be `.env`! Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with the one you copied.

```jsx
PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>"
```

## That’s a wrap

In this lesson, we learned about the different environments for blockchain networks and how to set up a testnet environment for deploying and testing NFT contracts. We also learned about the importance of keeping private keys secure and not sharing them publicly. Remember to always be vigilant and keep your keys safe!
