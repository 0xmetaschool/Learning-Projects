# What Are We Building Today?

GM everyone ‚òÄÔ∏è, today we are very excited to bring a super exciting course on Fuel blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So, what are we building? Believe it or not, we will build a petitions dApp using the Sway programming language on the Fuel blockchain. And this will serve as a huge learning step for you all. So let‚Äôs give it our all to this!!

Fuel is an L2 blockchain that aims to provide low cost for transactions at a high speed. Fuel believes that modular blockchains are the future. It offers separate execution from consensus and availability of data‚Äìwhich increases the bandwidth capacity significantly. Fuel is supported by Blockchain Capital, Stratos, CoinFund, Spartan, and many more.
