# Set Up the Sway Project

Welcome back! We’re so proud of you for completing the basics of the Sway programming language. Now without any delay, we will create a Sway project and understand how it works.

## Set up your first Sway project

Let’s start by building the basic Sway project. This project we will use to build our first Petition dApp on Fuel. Open the terminal in your system and start following the instructions to set up your project.

1. Start by creating a new and empty folder. Let’s call it `petition-app`. You can call it whatever you want to.

```
mkdir petition-app
```

2. Move inside of the folder, we just created.

```
cd petition-app
```

3. Create the fuel project using the following command.

```
forc new petition-contract
```

After executing the command, you can expect to receive the output mentioned below. 

```
To compile, use `forc build`, and to run tests use `forc test`

## Project structure

Now, open the project folder, `petition-app` in the VS code. Here’s what the project structure will look like.

### `Forc.toml` file

`Forc.toml` is a manifest file, the same as the `Cargo.toml` file (Think of `Cargo.toml` as `package.json` in the context of Rust). It defines the metadata of the project such as the project name and dependencies. Let’s look at what it looks like by default.

```
[project]
authors = ["Author Name"]
entry = "main.sw"
license = "Apache-2.0"
name = "petition-contract"

[dependencies]
```

You can also edit the `Forc.toml` file, to make it work best for you. For our `petition-contract`, we need a `toolchain` and `forc` and `fuel-core` components (Fuel SDK dependencies). So, let’s update our `Forc.toml` file.

```
[project]
authors = ["Author Name"]
entry = "main.sw"
license = "Apache-2.0"
name = "petition-contract"

[toolchain]
channel = "latest-2023-07-18"

[components]
forc = "0.46.1"
fuel-core = "0.20.5"
```

### Setup the project

Open the `src/main.sw` file and delete any existing code apart from the first line. It is important to start every Sway file with a declaration of its program type. So, in `main.sw` file, we are defining that our file will be a contract using the following line.

```
contract;
```

Let’s create a new folder inside of the `src` folder. 

```
cd petition-contract
cd src
mkdir data_structures
```

The updated project structure will look like this.

We will use the `data_structures` folder to create different components of our `petition-contract` such as creating a campaign, tracking the campaign, and representing the current state of the campaign to the user and keeping track of the number of signs on one campaign.

## That’s a wrap

Great work on setting up your first project on Fuel blockchain. We will use this project to create our petition dApp. 

We need to write different components to make our petition dApp stand out. So, we will not only write code in the `main.sw` file, but write code in multiple files and build different components of our petition dApp.

In the next lesson, we will start with writing the code for different components inside of the `data_structures` folder. So, get ready for some exciting work!
