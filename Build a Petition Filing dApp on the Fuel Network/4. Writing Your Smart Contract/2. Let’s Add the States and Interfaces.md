# Let’s Add the States and Interfaces

I’m so proud of you for coming this far in the course. In this lesson, we will start building our petition dApp. During our last lesson, we discussed the need to incorporate various components into our petition dApp. These components are what will be called interfaces. 

## Adding interfaces to our petition dApp

The contract in Sway is callable and stateful. It is deployed to the blockchain via transaction. Think of a smart contract as a deployed API that comes with a database state. In Sway, each file is defined by a program type, followed by the import of an ABI. So, before moving on to writing our contract, `main.sw`. We will write four different ABIs that we will eventually use in our smart contract. These ABIs are like libraries that will perform different tasks and help us keep records of the different information.

We will start by adding the interfaces (ABI) to the `data_structures` folder. Let’s look at what they will be.

1. Campaign creation ABI - Keeps record of the information of a campaign
2. Campaign track ABI - Keeps track of the campaign one user has created
3. Campaign State ABI - Keeps record of the state of a campaign
4. Number of signs ABI - Keeps track of the number of signs on one campaign

Let’s start implementing them one by one and understand the code side by side.

## Creating the campaign state library

First of all, we will begin with implementing the state library. We need a state library because it will help us keep a record of whether the campaign is currently going on, in progress, or has been canceled. We will implement state before implementing campaign information because we will use the state library in campaign information. We want to save the state of the campaign in the campaign information as well.

Create a `campaign_state.sw` file inside of the `src/data_structures` folder. Here’s what the new project structure will look like.

![fuel-structure-3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/refs/heads/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_petition_fuel/6.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Add%20the%20States%20and%20Interfaces/fuel-structure-3.webp)

Let’s start coding. We will write and explain the code line by line for you to understand everything in detail.

### Add `library` keyword

```
library;
```

In Sway, the file defined with a `library` keyword defines a new common behavior. The best example of this is the [Sway standard library](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/sway-lib-std). Libraries are defined using the `library` keyword, as we did here.

### Import libraries

```
use core::ops::Eq;
```

Followed by a `library` keyword comes the imports. Immediately after defining our file, we must import the existing libraries we need to build our own library. In this case, we are importing `ops::Eq` from the `core` library.

### Create a public enum

```
/// Represents the current state of the campaign.
pub enum CampaignState {
    /// The campaign has been canceled.
    pub Cancelled: (),
    /// The campaign was successful
    pub Successful: (),
    /// The campaign is still accepting funds.
    pub Progress: (),
}
```

First, we are defining the `CampaignState` enum that will help us keep track of the campaign state. It has three data fields, which we will use to store the state information.

1. `Cancelled`
2. `Successful`
3. `Progress`

### Create `CampaignState` ABI

```
impl Eq for CampaignState {
    fn eq(self, other: CampaignState) -> bool {
        match (self, other) {
            (CampaignState::Cancelled, CampaignState::Cancelled) => true,
            (CampaignState::Sucessful, CampaignState::Sucessful) => true,
            (CampaignState::Progress, CampaignState::Progress) => true,
            _ => false,
        }
    }
}
```

`impl` is used to implement the ABI library, `CampaignState`. The eq function allows us to take the CampaignState as an input, and check whether any of the data fields is equal to true, otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Complete code
You can find the complete code of `campaign_state.sw` file [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/petition-contract/blob/main/src/data_structures/campaign_state.sw).

## Creating a campaign information library

We need a campaign library for our petition dApp because it will help us keep a record of any campaign a user wants. As there can be multiple campaigns running at a time, it is important to keep a record of each campaign. So, let’s start making a library that will keep a detailed record of the campaign information on the Fuel blockchain. 

Create a `campaign_info.sw` file inside of the `src/data_structures` folder. Here’s what the new project structure will look like.

![fuel-structure-4.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/refs/heads/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_petition_fuel/6.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Add%20the%20States%20and%20Interfaces/fuel-structure-4.webp)

Let’s start coding. We will write and explain the code line by line for you to understand everything in detail.

### Add `library` keyword

```
library;
```

As we have discussed before that we need to define the program type of each file in Sway. We are defining our ABI with a `library` keyword.

### Import libraries

```
use ::data_structures::campaign_state::CampaignState;
```

As we have mentioned before, we must import the existing libraries we need to build our own library. Here, we are importing the `CampaignState` from the `data_structures/campaign_state.sw` file that will help us build our own data structure for the campaign.

### Create a new data structure

```
// General data structure containing information about a campaign.
pub struct CampaignInfo {
    /// The user who has created the campaign.
    pub author: Identity,
    // Whether the campaign is currently: in progress, successful, or Canceled.
    pub state: CampaignState,
    /// The end time for the campaign after which it becomes locked.
    pub deadline: u64,
    /// Total amount of signs received
    pub total_signs: u64,
}
```

We created a new data structure using the `struct` keyword. This struct defined the number of variables, we want to use to save the data details for our campaign. `pub` defines that the `struct` is accessible to the public. Let's see what the variables will be used.

**`author: Identity`**

We are defining an `author` of type `Identity`, which we will use to save the information of the author who created the campaign. `Identity` is an enum that allows handling both `address` and `ContractId` types. Identity comes in handy when we don’t know the exact type of data we will get. It can be addressed or the contract. An `Identity` is implemented as follows.

```
pub enum Identity {
    Address: Address,
    ContractId: ContractId,
}
```

**`state: CampaignState`**

The `state` is an instance of the `CampaignState` enum. We will use this instance to keep track of the campaign's state. It will allow us to know whether the campaign is still in progress, successful, or canceled.

**`deadline: u64`**

The `deadline` is `u64` type variable defining when to end the campaign. It helps automatically end the campaign without any external push. 

**`total_signs: u64`**

The `total_signs` is a `u64`-type variable that helps keep a record of the total number of signs who signed the campaign.

### Create `CampaignInfo` ABI

```
impl CampaignInfo {
    /// Creates a new campaign.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `asset`: [ContractId] - The asset that this campaign accepts as a deposit.
    /// * `author`: [Identity] - The user who has created the campaign.
    /// * `deadline`: [u64] - The end time for the campaign after which it becomes locked.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * [CampaignInfo] - The newly created campaign.
    pub fn new(
        author: Identity,
        deadline: u64,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            author,
            state: CampaignState::Progress,
            deadline,
            total_signs: 0,
        }
    }
}
```

`impl` is used to implement the ABI library. Here, we are implementing `CampaignInfo` ABI which is being used to create an instance of the `CampaignInfo` struct. `impl CampaignInfo` creates a new campaign, takes data as input, and saves it in the data fields. Let’s divide the code further and understand it in a bit more detail. 

**`pub fn new(author: Identity, deadline: u64) -> Self {}`**

Inside the `impl CampaignInfo`, we are defining a public function that takes two inputs, `author` and `deadline` of type `Identity` and `u64`, respectively. We will use these two inputs to fill the data fields. The function returns `Self` meaning it is returning the instance of itself.

**`Self { author, state: CampaignState::Progress, deadline, total_signs: 0, }`**

This line uses the input parameters and creates a new instance of the `CampaignInfo` ABI.


### Complete code
You can find the complete code of `campaign_info.sw` file [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/petition-contract/blob/main/src/data_structures/campaign_info.sw).


## Create a campaign library

We need a library that will store the information of what campaigns a user is creating. One use might create two or more campaigns. So, we need to keep track of the campaign on a user basis. Here’s where the `Campaign` library comes in.

Create a `campaign.sw` file inside of the `src/data_structures` folder. Here’s what the new project structure will look like.

![fuel-structure-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/refs/heads/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_petition_fuel/6.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Add%20the%20States%20and%20Interfaces/fuel-structure-5.webp)

Let’s start coding. We will write and explain the code line by line for you to understand everything in detail.

### Add `library` keyword

```
library;
```

As we have discussed before that we need to define the program type of each file in Sway. We are defining our ABI with a `library` keyword.

### Create a public data structure

```
/// Used to track the campaigns that a user has created.
pub struct Campaign {
    /// The unique identifier for the campaign.
    pub id: u64,
}
```

Here, we are defining a public `struct`, `Campaign`, which stores the user `id` in a `u64`-type data field.

### Create `Campaign` ABI

```
impl Campaign {
    /// Creates a new campaign.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `id`: [u64] - The unique identifier for the campaign.
    pub fn new(id: u64) -> Self {
        Self { id }
    }
}
```

Here, we are simply defining the constructor function for the `Campaign` struct.

### Complete code
You can find the complete code of `campaign.sw` file [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/petition-contract/blob/main/src/data_structures/campaign.sw).


## Create sign library

Create `signs.sw` file inside of the `src/data_structures` folder. Here’s what the new project structure will look like.

![fuel-structure-6.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/refs/heads/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_petition_fuel/6.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Add%20the%20States%20and%20Interfaces/fuel-structure-6.webp)

Let’s start coding. We will write and explain the code line by line for you to understand everything in detail.

### Add `library` keyword

```
library;
```

As we have discussed before that we need to define the program type of each file in Sway. We are defining our ABI with a `library` keyword.

### Create `Signs` struct

```
/// Used to track the amount signed by a user to a specific campaign.
pub struct Signs {
    /// Signing to a campaign; it should be always 1
    pub sign: u8,
    /// The unique identifier for the campaign.
    pub campaign_id: u64,
}
```

Here, we are defining a public `struct`, `Signs`, which stores the user ID in a `u64`-type data field.

### Create `Signs` ABI

```
impl Signs {
    /// Creates a new sign.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `campaign_id`: [u64] - The unique identifier for the campaign.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * [sign] - The new sign.
    pub fn new(campaign_id: u64) -> Self {
        Self {
            sign: 1,
            campaign_id,
        }
    }
}
```

We are creating the ABI, `Signs`, using `impl` keyword. It contains a constructor function that takes the campaign ID and initializes the initial state of the `Signs` `struct`.

### Complete code
You can find the complete code of `signs.sw` file [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/petition-contract/blob/main/src/data_structures/signs.sw).

## Create data structures file

We’re done with creating the interfaces. Now, we need a file outside of the `data_strcutures` folder that can help us import all interface libraries easily using one library.

Create `data_structures.sw` file inside of the `src` folder. Here’s what the new project structure will look like.

![fuel-structure-7.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/refs/heads/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_petition_fuel/6.%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Add%20the%20States%20and%20Interfaces/fuel-structure-7.webp)

The following code will be added to the `data_structures.sw` file.

```
library;

pub mod campaign_state;
pub mod campaign_info;
pub mod campaign;
pub mod signs;
```

After defining the file program type using the `library` keyword, we import all of the interfaces into on file. Later, we can use this file to import all of the extended libraries.

### Complete code
You can find the complete code of `data_structures.sw` file [here](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/petition-contract/blob/main/src/data_structures.sw).


## That’s a wrap

Great work on completing the 1st milestone of building your petition dApp. Next, we will implement the events and interface libraries.
