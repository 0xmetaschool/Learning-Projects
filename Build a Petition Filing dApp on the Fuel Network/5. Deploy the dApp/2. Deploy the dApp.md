# Deploy the dApp

Kudos to you for making it so far! Now we will finally deploy our dApp on the Fuel blockchain. Yayyy!!

Open a new terminal in your `petition-contract` directory or continue using the previous terminal if opened. 

Run the following command to build your files:

```
forc build
```

This will generate the following output:

Now let’s deploy the dApp using the following command:

```
forc deploy --testnet
```

- Once you use this command, it will ask you your the password of the wallet.
- After you provide the correct password, you will then be asked to provide the index of the account to use for signing - here you can write **0**.
- Lastly, you will be asked if you agree to sign this transaction. You can type **y** to approve the transaction.

The output should look like so:

After deploying the contract, go back to Visual Studio code to your `petition-contract` folder. Here, you will find an extra `out` folder. Inside of the out folder, you’ll see two more folders: `debug` and `deployments`. The `debug` folder here contains the ABI files. We will use these ABI files to connect our deployed smart contract with the front end. Here’s what the project structure looks like:

**Note:** Please make sure you deploy the contract correctly because without ABI files you cannot cannot connect your Fuel project with the front end.

## That’s a wrap

In conclusion, we learned how to deploy a dApp on the Fuel blockchain. We built our files using `forc build` and deployed the dApp using `forc deploy --testnet`. Now, let's add the frontend to our dApp.
