# Introduction to NFTs

Let's start our course with an introduction to NFTs without further ado.

## What are NFTs, anyway?

NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenise things like art, collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable for other items because they have unique properties.

Fungible items, on the other hand, can be exchanged because their value defines them rather than their unique properties. For example, ETH or dollars are fungible because 1 ETH / $1 USD is exchangeable for another 1 ETH / $1 USD.

Hurray! Now you have all the basic knowledge about NFTs. Go-ahead, brag about it to your friends! But, wait! There’s still more to learn. Let’s talk about the internet of assets now!

## The internet of assets

NFTs and Ethereum solve some of the problems that exist on the internet today. As everything becomes more digital, there's a need to replicate the properties of physical items like scarcity, uniqueness, and proof of ownership. Not to mention that digital items often only work in the context of their product. For example you can't re-sell an iTunes mp3 you've purchased, or you can't exchange one company's loyalty points for another platform's credit even if there's a market for it.

Here's how an internet of NFTs compared to the internet most of us use today looks...

## A comparison

| NFTs are digitally unique, no two NFTs are the same.                                                                                                                                                        | A copy of a file, like an .mp3 or .jpg, is the same as the original.                                                                                                       |
| Every NFT must have an owner and this is of public record and easy for anyone to verify.                                                                                                                    | Ownership records of digital items are stored on servers controlled by institutions – you must take their word for it.                                                     |
| NFTs are compatible with anything built using Ethereum. An NFT ticket for an event can be traded on every Ethereum marketplace, for an entirely different NFT. You could trade a piece of art for a ticket! | Companies with digital items must build their own infrastructure. For example an app that issues digital tickets for events would have to build their own ticket exchange. |
| Content creators can sell their work anywhere and can access a global market.                                                                                                                               | Creators rely on the infrastructure and distribution of the platforms they use. These are often subject to terms of use and geographical restrictions.                     |
| Creators can retain ownership rights over their own work, and claim resale royalties directly.                                                                                                              | Platforms, such as music streaming services, retain the majority of profits from sales.                                                                                    |
| Items can be used in surprising ways. For example, you can use digital artwork as collateral in a decentralised loan.                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                            |

Makes sense, right! No wonder why everyone wants to ride the NFT tide! Check out some of these examples:

## NFT examples

The NFT world is relatively new. In theory, the scope for NFTs is anything that is unique that needs provable ownership. Here are some examples of NFTs that exist today, to help you get the idea:

Oh, no! Are you one of those people who think your time, effort and money might go to waste with NFTs? Well, Nah! Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here. But we assure you that it's absolutely safe, and worth your time and effort. The mechanism stated below will put your mind at ease too!

### The Technology Behind NFTs
##Blockchain Technology
At the core of NFTs lies blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. This ensures the security and immutability of NFTs, as every transaction is verified by the network.

## Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of an NFT transaction, ensuring trust and transparency without needing intermediaries. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for creating and managing NFTs due to its robust smart contract capabilities.

## How NFTs Work
Minting
Creating an NFT is known as minting. When an NFT is minted, it is recorded on the blockchain, and a unique identifier is assigned to it. This identifier is linked to the asset it represents, along with metadata that provides additional information about the asset.

## Ownership and Provenance
One of the key features of NFTs is the ability to track ownership and provenance. Every time an NFT changes hands, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This allows anyone to verify the current owner and the entire history of the NFT, providing transparency and security.

## Interoperability
NFTs are designed to be interoperable across different platforms and applications. This means that an NFT created on one platform can be used or traded on another platform that supports the same standards. For instance, an NFT minted on Ethereum can be traded on various Ethereum-compatible marketplaces.

## The Value of NFTs
Digital Scarcity
NFTs introduce the concept of digital scarcity, making it possible to own rare and unique digital items. This scarcity can drive value, much like how rarity increases the value of physical collectibles.

## Empowering Creators
NFTs provide a new way for creators to monetize their work. Artists, musicians, writers, and other content creators can sell their work directly to consumers without relying on intermediaries. Moreover, smart contracts can be programmed to provide creators with royalties from secondary sales, ensuring they continue to benefit as their work appreciates in value.

## Community and Engagement
NFTs can foster a sense of community and engagement. For example, owning an NFT from a particular artist or brand can grant access to exclusive events, content, or experiences. This can create a deeper connection between creators and their audiences.

## Future Potential of NFTs
Real-World Assets
The potential for NFTs extends beyond digital items. They can be used to represent ownership of real-world assets such as real estate, vehicles, or even shares in a company. This could revolutionize how we buy, sell, and trade physical assets by providing a secure and transparent way to prove ownership.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
NFTs can also play a role in decentralized finance (DeFi). They can be used as collateral for loans, fractionalized to allow for shared ownership, or integrated into various financial products. This opens up new possibilities for liquidity and investment opportunities.

## Identity and Credentials
NFTs could be used to represent identity and credentials. For example, educational institutions could issue diplomas as NFTs, providing a verifiable and tamper-proof record of one's academic achievements. Similarly, NFTs could be used to store and manage digital identities securely.
