# What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone üåà, we are very excited to bring the exciting course for developers just like you, who want to get started with the NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) ecosystem!

So, what are we building today? Today I will be helping you learn everything about NFTs. To be precise, my focus will be on teaching you what exactly NFTs are and how you can build your own NFTs.

Why NFTs? Becuase NFTs have gained significant popularity and are being used in various industries and applications. Some of those industries and applications are:

1. Digital Art
2. Collectibles
3. Gaming
4. Virtual Worlds
5. Music and Entertainment
6. Domain Names

Some of the popular NFTs projects are:

1. [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)
2. [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/)
3. [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)
4. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)
5. [Beeple's Everydays](https://opensea.io/accounts/beeple)

Not only this, you can also earn money using NFTs. Around 5K NFTs are being sold daily as of April 2023. "The Merge" is the biggest authentic NFT sale to date that was sold for $91.8 million in December 2021. Cool, isn't it?

## Course overview

Together, we will:

1. Learn what exactly NFTs are
2. Learn how does NFTs work
3. Look into where NFTs are being used
4. Lastly, we will learn how to build your own NFT

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for developers those have basic programming knowledge and want to expand that knowledge by entering into the Blockchain ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Learning new tech is always easier when you got some prior knowledge. So, before diving into NFTs, we recommend brushing up on the following:

1. Blockchain basics: It's super helpful if you got a basic understanding of Blockchain and how does it work.
2. Ethereum Blockchain: To wrap your head around the complex and abstract concepts in Ethereum NFTs, you'll need some understanding of Ethereum Blockchain.

But don't sweat it ‚Äì you can still learn NFTs without knowing everything in advance. It's just gonna be way smoother if you got some background knowledge under your belt.

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
