# Deploy Smart Contracts

Welcome back! You did great in the last lesson, coding all smart contracts. In this lesson, you will learn to compile and deploy your smart contracts. Let’s start this awesome journey!

We need a deployment script for compiling two Solidity smart contracts, `HogwartsNFT` and `RandomHouseAssignment`, using the Hardhat framework.

Navigate to `scripts` folder and remove the existing content of `deploy.js`. Let’s write our new code in `deploy.js`.

## Write code

Let’s start writing code:

**Import Hardhat:**

```
const hre = require("hardhat");
```

- The script imports the Hardhat library to access Ethereum development tools and configurations.

**Environment Variables:**

```
const vrfCoordinatorV2Address = process.env.VRFaddress;
const subId = process.env.SubId;
const keyHash = process.env.keyHash;
const callbackGasLimit = process.env.gasLimit;
```

- The script reads environment variables for VRF (Verifiable Random Function) settings, such as the VRF coordinator's address, subscription ID, key hash, and gas limit. yes, it utilizes the

**Main Function:**

```
async function main() {
```

- The `main` function is defined, which will perform the deployment and ownership transfer of the contracts.

**Deploying Hogwarts NFT Contract:**

```
console.log("Deploying Hogwarts NFT Contract...");
// Deploying Hogwarts NFT contract
const HogwartsNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("HogwartsNFT");
const hogwartsNFT = await HogwartsNFT.deploy();
```

- It logs a message indicating the deployment of the `Hogwarts NFT` contract.
- It uses Hardhat to create a factory for the `HogwartsNFT` contract and then deploys it.

**Waiting for Confirmation Blocks:**

```
let currentBlock = await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
while (currentBlock + 5 > (await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber())) {}
```

- It retrieves the current block number and waits for 5 additional blocks to be mined before proceeding. This is often done to ensure that the contract deployment is confirmed on the network.

**Getting the Contract Address:**

```
const hogwartsAddress = await hogwartsNFT.getAddress();
console.log("Hogwarts NFT deployed to:", hogwartsAddress);
```

- It obtains the Ethereum address of the deployed `Hogwarts NFT` contract and logs it.

**Deploying Random House Assignment Contract:**

```
console.log("Deploying Random House Assignment Contract...");
// Deploying Random House Assignment contract
const RandomHouse = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("RandomHouseAssignment");
const randomHouse = await RandomHouse.deploy(hogwartsAddress, vrfCoordinatorV2Address, subId, keyHash, callbackGasLimit);
```

- It logs a message indicating the deployment of the "Random House Assignment" contract.
- It uses Hardhat to create a factory for the "RandomHouseAssignment" contract and then deploys it, passing various parameters including the address of the "Hogwarts NFT" contract.

**Waiting for Confirmation Blocks (Again):**

```
while (currentBlock + 5 > (await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber())) {}
```

- Similar to earlier, it waits for an additional 5 blocks to be mined after deploying the "Random House Assignment" contract.

**Getting the Contract Address (Again):**

```
const randomAddress = await randomHouse.getAddress();
console.log("Random House Assignment deployed to:", randomAddress);
```

- It obtains the Ethereum address of the deployed "Random House Assignment" contract and logs it.

**Transferring Ownership:**

```
// Transferring ownership
await hogwartsNFT.transferOwnership(randomAddress);
console.log("Ownership transferred");
}
```

- It transfers ownership of the "Hogwarts NFT" contract to the "Random House Assignment" contract. This step ensures that the "Random House Assignment" contract has control over the NFTs.

**Execute the Main Function:**

```
main();
```

- Finally, the script calls the `main` function to execute the deployment and ownership transfer processes.

## Complete code

The complete code for `deploy.js`**:**

```
const hre = require("hardhat");

const vrfCoordinatorV2Address = process.env.VRFaddress;
const subId = process.env.SubId;
const keyHash = process.env.keyHash;
const callbackGasLimit = process.env.gasLimit;

async function main() {

    console.log("Deploying Hogwarts NFT Contract...")

    const HogwartsNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("HogwartsNFT");
    const hogwartsNFT = await HogwartsNFT.deploy();

    let currentBlock = await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
    while (currentBlock + 5 > (await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber())) {}

    const hogwartsAddress = await hogwartsNFT.getAddress();
    console.log("Hogwarts NFT deployed to:", hogwartsAddress);

    console.log("Deploying Random House Assignment Contract...")

    const RandomHouse = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("RandomHouseAssignment");
    const randomHouse = await RandomHouse.deploy(hogwartsAddress, vrfCoordinatorV2Address, subId, keyHash, callbackGasLimit);

    while (currentBlock + 5 > (await hre.ethers.provider.getBlockNumber())) {}

    const randomAddress = await randomHouse.getAddress();
    console.log("Random House Assignment deployed to:", randomAddress);

    //Transfering ownership
    await hogwartsNFT.transferOwnership(randomAddress);
    console.log("Ownership transferred");

  }

  main();
```

## Update `hardhat.config.js`

We need to add the wallet and network details so hardhat knows who is deploying on which network. Open `hardhat.config.js` and replace the existing content with the following:

```
require('dotenv').config();
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "polygon_amoy",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    polygon_amoy: {
      url: "https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_amoy",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.20",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },
}
```

## Deploy the contracts

Now we are ready to compile the contracts using the following command:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon_amoy
```

You will see an output like this:

You will also notice that the new folders named `artifacts` is created in `hogwarts-dapp`. We need the json files of our contracts created in frontend.

Navigate to `artifacts/contracts`, a folder for each contract you deployed will be create. Copy the `json files`. I have highlighted which json files you need to copy.

![Frame 3560365 (38).jpg](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20Hogwarts%20Sorting%20Cap%20dApp%20on%20the%20Polygon%20Mumbai/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/Frame_3560365_(38).jpg?raw=true>)

## Add consumers to Chainlink

Next, we will follow the following steps to add consumer to Chainlink:

- Copy the contract addresses of the contract you have just deployed.
  ![Frame 3560364 (38) copy.jpg](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20Hogwarts%20Sorting%20Cap%20dApp%20on%20the%20Polygon%20Mumbai/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/Frame_3560364_(38)_copy.jpg?raw=true>)
- Head over to [https://vrf.chain.link/polygon-amoy](https://vrf.chain.link/polygon-amoy).
- Click on the subscription ID you are using.
- Click on “Add consumer”.
- Paste your contract address.
- Click on “Add consumer”.
- Click on “Confirm” to approve the transaction.

See how I did it in the following gif:

![Frame 3560365 (29).gif](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Build%20Hogwarts%20Sorting%20Cap%20dApp%20on%20the%20Polygon%20Mumbai/Deploy%20Smart%20Contracts/Frame_3560365_(29).gif?raw=true>)

Repeat the same process for the other contract address.

And with this, we are ready to move on to the next step!

## Wrap up

In this lesson, you learned how to compile and deploy smart contracts using the Hardhat framework. You also created a deployment script for compiling two Solidity smart contracts, `HogwartsNFT` and `RandomHouseAssignment`, and transferred ownership of the `HogwartsNFT` contract to the `RandomHouseAssignment` contract.

We will work on frontend in the next lesson.
