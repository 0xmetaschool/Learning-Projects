# Secure Your Data

Greetings folks! We have set up our project. Now we need some private data to deploy the contracts so let’s see how we can secure that. And we will also fetch some API keys and other data that will be required later. Let’s go!!

## Why there’s a need to secure data?

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key of MetaMask wallet to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Let’s do the following.

## Create `.env` file

Let’s use `.env` file to store all the secrets and important keys related to your project so we can access this data whenever and wherever.

Create a file named `.env` in the folder `hogwarts-dapp` and copy the following data in the file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY"
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY="YOUR_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY"
VRFaddress="YOUR_VRF_COORDINATOR_ADDRESS"
SubId="YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
keyHash="YOUR_KEY_HASH"
gasLimit="50000"
```

My `.env` file looks like this:

- If `gitignore` file is not created then create a file named `.gitignore` file in the folder `hogwarts-dapp`. In the `gitignore` file, we’ll simply write `.env`, so that it tells git to ignore that file from future commits. And we do not accidentally push our secrets data to public.

## Get your private MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hackers can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

1. Open the MetaMask extension to find your private key.
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on 3 dots on right side and go to “Account Details”.
4. Click on “Show private key”.
5. Enter MetaMask password.
6. Copy your private key.
7. Replace `YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key in the `.env` file.

## PolygonScan API

Now you need to have an API so follow the steps given below:

- Head over to [https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/).
- Login or signup to PolygonScan.
- Go to “API-KEYs” on the left navigation bar.
- If you don’t have an API key. Generate one by clicking on “+Add” button.
- After generating the key, copy your Api-Key Token.
- Replace `YOUR_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY` with yours in the `.env` file.

## Chainlink

Follow the steps given below:

- Head over to [https://vrf.chain.link/polygon-amoy](https://vrf.chain.link/polygon-amoy).
- Click on “Connect wallet” and connect your MetaMask wallet.
- Copy “VRF Coordinator” and replace `YOUR_VRF_COORDINATOR_ADDRESS` with yours in the `.env` file. I have pointed out the address in the following image for your ease.

- Copy the “Key Hash” address and replace `YOUR_KEY_HASH` with yours in the `.env` file. I have pointed out the hash in the following image for your ease.

### Create subscription

- Next, click on Create Subscription:
  - Click on Create Subscription.
  - Sign the transaction.
  - Confirm the transaction.
  - Wait for a few seconds. Click on the “Add Funds” pop-up but move to the home page without adding any link.

- Now go back to “Home”. Under “My Subscriptions”, you’ll find the subscription you created just yet. Click on it and copy the subscription ID.
- Replace `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with your ID in the `.env` file.

Awesome, setting all of this was a lot but you did great! Now, you are all set up to start writing the code!

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we have learned how to secure our data using `.env` file. Then we fetched the required data and utilized MetaMask wallet, Polygon faucet, PolygonScan API, and Chainlink for that.

Now that our development environment is ready, we can move on to building our dApp. Stay tuned for the next lesson!
