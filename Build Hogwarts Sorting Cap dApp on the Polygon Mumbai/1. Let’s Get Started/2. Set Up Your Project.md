# Set Up Your Project

Greetings folks! Let‚Äôs dive right into setting up our project. Let‚Äôs go!!

## What is a development environment?

You now need a super cool environment to run your code in and you need to set it up!

For this tutorial, you will use MetaMask wallet, Polygon faucet, PolygonScan API, Chainlink, Hardhat, and IDE like Visual Studio for compiling and deploying your code. Don‚Äôt worry, setting them up is easy and you will do it in no time!

## MetaMask

If you do not have MetaMask extension, you can install it in your browser using [Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

### Setting up the testnet environment

Now we need to set the testnet network so we can deploy our app on it. Complete the following steps to set it up:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/80002](https://chainlist.org/chain/80002).
- Click on ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on ‚ÄúAdd to Metamask‚Äù.
- Click on Approve and then Switch Network.

You will be successfully connected to the Amoy network.


### Get some fake MATIC $$ ü§ë

Now it's time to get some money!

- Head over to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
- Make sure you select "Amoy" network.
- Copy your account address.
- Paste your wallet address.
- Click on the Submit button.
- Wait for a few seconds, you will receive 0.2 MATIC.

See in the following gif how I did it:

## Set Hardhat project

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```
mkdir hogwarts-dapp
cd hogwarts-dapp
npm install --save-dev hardhat@2.20.0
```

Initialize a new Hardhat project using the following command:

```
npx hardhat init
```

Create a JavaScript project. Just follow through with the questions and answer them yes. For me, it was something like this:
![hogwarts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e3c8a6-b292-49c4-9807-7eeb47040d83)

Install all dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install --force
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan dotenv ethers --force
npm install ethers@6.8.0 --force
```

Your project directory now looks like this:

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we have got some fake MATICs and set up our Hardhat project and installed necessary dependencies. Next, we will learn to secure necessary data.
