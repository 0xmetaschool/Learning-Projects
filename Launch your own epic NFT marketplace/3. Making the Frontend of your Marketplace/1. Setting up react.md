# Setting up react

We will now create the framework for a basic react app quickly using the command.

```
npx create-react-app collections-react
```

You should now see a folder called `collections-react` with all of the basic react template code inside it.

- **Note:** You can also make this react app directory separately from the smart contract directory. But to do that you will have to install ethers in the new react directory using this command `npm i ethers`.

## Setting up Pinata

Before we start minting NFTs, we need to define what they will look like.

We need to find images that we want to use, we need to write metadatas for our NFTs (Remember when we talked about metadatas before?)

We are going to provide you with our own images and metadatas to make your work a little bit easier. But if you are feeling creative today, we highly encourage you to put up your own images and create your own metadatas and add them in the `assets` folder in `collections-react/public`. Let’s create `assests` folder.

```
cd collections-react 
mkdir public/assets
```

This is where we `assets` folder will be created:

Now go ahead and download `images` and `metadata` folders from [here.](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/tree/main/assets/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20marketplace) If you like the assets don’t forget to star us on GitHub. 

We will be creating 5 NFTs for our marketplace. You can find the images for these NFTs in the `images` folder and metadata will be in the `metadata` folder. Copy the `images` and `metadata` folders to `assets` folder. I have shown the project directory in the following image:

![Frame 3560365 (16).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(16).webp?raw=true)

You can’t pass a complete image to your smart contract. You first need to host it onto a decentralized IPFS (Inter Planetary File System). The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. We will be using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) for storing the metadata of our NFTs.

So go and make a [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) account quickly and come back.

**This is important, follow the steps quickly.**

Once you login to your pinata dashboard, upload the `images` folder from assets folder to it. See in the following gif how I did it:

![Frame 3560365 (10).gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(10).webp?raw=true)

After uploading `images` folder, you will see something like shown below:

![Frame 3560365 (20).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(20).webp?raw=true)

We will add the individual links of all of these images to their respective metadatas. These metadata files are in the `collections-react/public/assets/metadata` folder and has the following content:

```
{
  "description": "This is polar bear NFT",
  "image": "<your-image-pinata-link-here>",
  "name": "Polar Bear"
}
```

 Let’s follow the steps given below to add the images link:

1. Click on the images folder on Pinata. You will see a window like this when you click on it.
    
    ![Frame 3560365 (18).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(18).webp?raw=true)
    

1. Click on each individual image and copy its url from the browser. For me, the link for image 1 is [https://peach-previous-raccoon-340.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXZ3TgRgd5EZEk2DhwGvjf8f6sQJNCrnHzrEw1oHufgnL/1.png](https://peach-previous-raccoon-340.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXZ3TgRgd5EZEk2DhwGvjf8f6sQJNCrnHzrEw1oHufgnL/1.png).
    
    ![Frame 3560365 (11).gif](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(11).webp?raw=true)
    
2. Go to `collections-react/public/assets/metadata` and open `1`.
3. Paste your link in front of `image` as shown below:
    
    ![Frame 3560365 (19).jpg](https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/Launch%20your%20own%20epic%20NFT%20place/3%20Making%20the%20Frontend%20of%20your%20Marketplace/1.%20Setting%20up%20react/Frame_3560365_(19).webp?raw=true)
    
4. Repeat the steps for other four images too.To do this, you now have to go the assets/metadata folder, and fill all 5 of the empty “image” values, with the corresponding IPFS link.

Great! Now that you have filled in the `metadata` folder completely, upload it to the IPFS using Pinata, just like we did for the `images`! In the next lesson, we will work on the frontend of our app.
