# Getting Started

## **Intro**

Welcome fellow programmers!  
  
My name is Tanishk Goyal, and I have a very exciting tutorial lined up for you today.

NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are all the buzz these days, from BoredApes to Crypto Kitties EVERYONE is talking about them.

But behind the creation of these seemingly innocent animal pictures, is a very sophisticated blockchain smart contract called the ERC 721.

Today I am going to take you through a complete journey of building your own NFT marketplace from complete scratch. This is how it will look like.

We will be setting up a minting price for our NFTs so that we can make some money for our NFT collection.

We will also setup a maximum limit on the number of NFTs one public address can buy, so that more people can get their hands on our super popular NFT collection.

But how will a user mint our super popular NFT collection? Because an average user isn’t a top-notch programmer like you and me, so I think we should also make up a simple react webpage where the user can mint our NFTs on the click of a button.

This is a great head start for anyone looking to create NFT collection or a marketplace and making money through it. This is how our marketplace will look like.

## Course Overview

So what exactly are we going to cover today

-   We will start of with setting up our development environment and downloading all the dependencies. The tech stack we will be using today is - Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, React and Ethers.js
-   We will then use the openzepellin library’s ERC721 smart contract, and inherit it to create our own NFT smart contract called Collection.sol
-   After that we will need to deploy our smart contract using ethers.js and check our deployment on etherscan.
-   Once all the solidity part is done, we’ll make a very simple react frontend for our website.
-   This webpage will be able to list 5 NFTs, a user would be able to connect to their metamask and mint any 2 of these NFTs.
-   And that’s it, you will now be able to see and enjoy your NFT in your own metamask wallet!

Don’t worry if this all seems overwhelming to you. I will help you on each and every step. We are in this together. 😅

If you complete this course with me today, you will be getting a special NFT, a utility token, which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is how the NFT looks like.
