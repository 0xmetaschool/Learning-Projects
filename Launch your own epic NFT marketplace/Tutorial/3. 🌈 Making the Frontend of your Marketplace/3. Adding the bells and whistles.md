# 🌈 Making the Frontend of your Marketplace

## **Adding the bells and whistles**

### Creating App.js functionalities

Populate the App.js file with the following code

```
import "./App.css";
import { Contract, ethers } from "ethers";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import contractABI from "./contractABI.json";
 
const contractAddress = "<your-contract-address-here>";
 
function App() {
 
    const [account, setAccount] = useState(null);
    const [isWalletInstalled, setIsWalletInstalled] = useState(false);
  const [NFTContract, setNFTContract] = useState(null);
  // state for whether app is minting or not.
    const [isMinting, setIsMinting] = useState(false);
 
 
  useEffect(() => {
        if (window.ethereum) {
            setIsWalletInstalled(true);
        }
    }, []);
 
  useEffect(() => {
        function initNFTContract() {
            const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      const signer = provider.getSigner();
      setNFTContract(new Contract(contractAddress,contractABI.abi,signer));
        }
        initNFTContract();
    }, [account]);
 
 
  async function connectWallet() {
        window.ethereum
            .request({
                method: "eth_requestAccounts",
            })
            .then((accounts) => {
                setAccount(accounts[0]);
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                alert("Something went wrong");
            });
    }
 
 
    const data = [
        {
            url: "./assets/images/1.png",
            param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
        },
        {
          url: "./assets/images/2.png",
            param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
        },
        {
          url: "./assets/images/3.png",
            param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
        },
        {
          url: "./assets/images/4.png",
            param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
        },
        {
          url: "./assets/images/5.png",
            param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
        },
    ];
 
    async function withdrawMoney(){
        try {
 
            const response = await NFTContract.withdrawMoney();
            console.log("Received: ", response);
          } catch (err) {
              alert(err);
          }
 
    }
 
    async function handleMint(tokenURI) {
        setIsMinting(true);
            try {
              const options = {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01")};
              const response = await NFTContract.mintNFT(tokenURI, options);
              console.log("Received: ", response);
            } catch (err) {
                alert(err);
            }
            finally {
              setIsMinting(false);
            }
    }
 
    if (account === null) {
      return (
        <>
         <div className="container">
           <br/>
          <h1> 🔮 metaschool</h1>
          <h2>NFT Marketplace</h2>
          <p>Buy an NFT from our marketplace.</p>
 
          {isWalletInstalled ? (
            <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
          ) : (
            <p>Install Metamask wallet</p>
          )}
          </div>
          </>
      );
    }
 
    return (
        <>
            <div className="container">
            <br/>
            <h1> 🔮 metaschool</h1>
 
             <h2>NFT Marketplace</h2>
                {data.map((item, index) => (
                    <div className="imgDiv">
                        <img
                            src={item.url}
                            key={index}
                            alt="images"
                            width={250}
                            height={250}
                        />
                        <button isLoading={isMinting}
                            onClick={() => {
                                eval(item.param);
                            }}
                        >
                            Mint - 0.01 eth
                        </button>
                    </div>
                ))}
                 <button 
                            onClick={() => {
                                withdrawMoney();
                            }}
                        >
                            Withdraw Money from Contract
                 </button>
 
        </div>
 
        </>
    );
}
 
export default App;
```

Now let us break down what is this code exactly doing -

## Connecting to Metamask

```
const [account, setAccount] = useState(null);
const [isWalletInstalled, setIsWalletInstalled] = useState(false);
const [NFTContract, setNFTContract] = useState(null);
  // state for whether app is minting or not.
const [isMinting, setIsMinting] = useState(false);
 
 
  useEffect(() => {
        if (window.ethereum) {
            setIsWalletInstalled(true);
        }
    }, []);
 
  useEffect(() => {
        function initNFTContract() {
            const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      const signer = provider.getSigner();
      setNFTContract(new Contract(contractAddress,contractABI.abi,signer));
        }
        initNFTContract();
    }, [account]);
 
 
  async function connectWallet() {
        window.ethereum
            .request({
                method: "eth_requestAccounts",
            })
            .then((accounts) => {
                setAccount(accounts[0]);
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                alert("Something went wrong");
            });
    }
```

This metaschool tutorial on  [How to Add MetaMask connect button to your react app](https://metaschool.so/courses/add-metamask-connect-button-to-your-react-app)  explains this code in great detail.  
We adopt there explanation here

-   useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value. We are starting with a false state for if the wallet is installed. And a null state for if an account is connected.
-   When you call useEffect , you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render.
-   MetaMask injects a global API into websites visited by its users at window.ethereum. This API allows websites to request users’ Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions. The function connectWallet simply does a remote procedure call to Ethereum via MetaMask. It returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the method call.

🚨🚨 Note: Ensure that your metamask extension is logged in (Not asking for password) while running the react app, otherwise you will get an error.

So our first page first checks if your metamask is connected or not, if it is not connected it gives you the option to connect using the connectWallet button

```
<div className="container">
  <br/>
 <h1> 🔮 metaschool</h1>
 <h2>NFT Marketplace</h2>
 <p>Buy an NFT from our marketplace.</p>
 
 {isWalletInstalled ? (
   <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>
 ) : (
   <p>Install Metamask wallet</p>
 )}
 </div>
```

Great so the next part of the code, is where you would populate your NFTs metadata into the marketplace. So you can display and mint these NFTs on the webpage.

🚨 Copy the assets folder provided to you, to the public folder in your react app.

Now populate this data with each image, and its corresponding metadata hosted on the IPFS.

```
const data = [
    {
        url: "./assets/images/1.png",
        param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
    },
    {
      url: "./assets/images/2.png",
        param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
    },
    {
      url: "./assets/images/3.png",
        param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
    },
    {
      url: "./assets/images/4.png",
        param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
    },
    {
      url: "./assets/images/5.png",
        param: "handleMint('<your-metadata-pinata-link-here>')",
    },
];
```

Before moving on to the next part, remember when I told you to store your deployed contract address for later? This is where we’ll use it.

So fill in your contract address here

```
const contractAddress = "<contract-address>";
```

And finally we come to the most important part of the react app. What to do when the user clicks on the mint button?

This code is handled by the handleMint function.

```
async function handleMint(tokenURI) {
    setIsMinting(true);
        try {
          const options = {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01")};
          const response = await NFTContract.mintNFT(tokenURI, options);
          console.log("Received: ", response);
        } catch (err) {
            alert(err);
        }
        finally {
          setIsMinting(false);
        } 
}
```

So what is going on here?

Everytime the user mints an NFT we call the handleMint function with the tokenURI or the IPFS link of the metadata of that NFT.

-   We then check if the user has a metamask wallet using window.ethereum
-   We then use the providers functionality provided to us by the ethers.js library to get the signer from your metamask wallet.
-   Then using the signer, the contract ABI, and the address of the contract you deployed to rinkeby, we create a new instance of a contract. We can interact with this local instance of the contract as if we are interacting with the deployed contract.
-   We then create a constant options which will hold the amount of money we want to buy the NFT for, in our case the NFT is valued at 0.01 eth, so we pass that into the parseEther function. If you put anything less than this the contract would reject your transaction, because we have coded it that way :)

This options constant, will populate the msg.value field of our transaction with 0.01 ether, remember when we used msg.value to check the amount of ether that has been paid to the smart contract?

-   Lastly we come to the final step of our journey, minting the NFT using contract.mintNFT(), this calls the mintNFT function of the deployed smart contract and passes the tokenURI and the option constant along with it.

And we are done!  
Yes, you heard me right, we are done!  
You can now mint your NFTs on your very own NFT marketplace.

🔥 But before we do that, here is some important information that you need to know before you start playing with your web app.  
You will encounter some alert errors when you click on certain buttons, do not panic!

Read these alerts carefully and you’ll see that they actually show that our smart contract is working properly.

If you read the error carefully, you’ll see that if you try using the smart contract incorrectly, for example if you try to withdraw money from an account which is not the owner, then you will be reverted.

So essentially these alerts are a good thing.

I encourage you to try and break the smart contract in various ways and look at the various errors that the contract throws at you, to see that all your functionalities are correctly working :)
