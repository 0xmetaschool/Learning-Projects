ðŸŽ‰ Writing smart contract
=========================

##### ðŸŽ‰ Writing the Collection.sol smart contract

Go to your contracts directory and make a new file called Collection.sol.

Populate this file with the following code -

    `//Contract based on [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)     // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT     pragma solidity ^0.8.9;     import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";     import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";     import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";     import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";     contract Collection is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {         using Counters for Counters.Counter;         Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;         Counters.Counter private _totalMinted;                  mapping(address => uint8) private mintedAddress;         mapping(string => uint8) private URIMapping;         uint256 public PRICE_PER_TOKEN = 0.01 ether;         uint256 public LIMIT_PER_ADDRESS = 2;         uint256 public MAX_SUPPLY  = 5;         constructor() ERC721("Collection", "NFT") {}                  function setPrice(uint256 price) external onlyOwner{             PRICE_PER_TOKEN = price;         }                  function setLimit(uint256 limit) external onlyOwner{             LIMIT_PER_ADDRESS = limit;         }                  function setMaxSupply(uint256 max_supply) external onlyOwner{             MAX_SUPPLY = max_supply;         }                  function mintNFT(string memory tokenURI)             payable             external             returns (uint256)         {             require(PRICE_PER_TOKEN <= msg.value, "Ether paid is incorrect");             require(mintedAddress[msg.sender] < LIMIT_PER_ADDRESS, "You have exceeded minting limit");             require(_totalMinted.current() + 1 <= MAX_SUPPLY, "You have exceeded Max Supply");             require(URIMapping[tokenURI] == 0, "This NFT has already been minted");             URIMapping[tokenURI] += 1;             mintedAddress[msg.sender] += 1;             _tokenIds.increment();             _totalMinted.increment();             uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();             _mint(msg.sender, newItemId);             _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);             return newItemId;         }                  function withdrawMoney() external onlyOwner{             address payable to = payable(msg.sender);             to.transfer(address(this).balance);         }     }`

Okay I know this is a lot of code, but it really isnâ€™t that complicated once you start understanding it.  
So letâ€™s go through it step by step.

We import 4 contracts from openzeppelin:

1.  ERC721 - Standard implementation of the ERC721 smart contract used for making NFTs
2.  Counters - Provides a secure way to increment or decrement a number by 1. We will use counters to keep a track of the token IDs of our minted NFTs
3.  Ownable - Allows us to use the â€˜onlyOwnerâ€™ modifier which in turn allows us to create functions that only the owner of the contract can use.
4.  ERC721URIStorage - This is an extension of the ERC721 smart contract, that provides a way to store the metadata in an array list on chain using the \_setTokenURI function.

### Let's understand the Mint function

In the mint function you should notice these things -

1.  We take in a parameter called the tokenURI. This is a link to the metadata of our NFT. A metadata is like the soul of our NFT. Your NFT is unique because of the metadata it has. It contains the complete information about the NFT like image or description. We will come back to the metadata soon, when we talk about IPFS hosting.
2.  We increment our token ID for storing the NFTs metadata and minting the NFT using the following piece of code, we also increment the total Number of NFTs minted so that we can check it does not exceed our total supply.

    `_tokenIds.increment();     _totalMinted.increment();     uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();`

1.  We call the internal \_mint() function to mint the NFT with the new token ID and airdropping it to our public address - msg.sender.

We also store the tokenURI in an array at the index of the new tokenID using \_setTokenURI()

### ðŸš¨ Quick Detour About this magical word - msg

msg provides us with a set of incredibly useful global variables, that we can use to extract important information from the blockchain.

We will be using the following global variables in this tutorial:

1.  msg.sender - Gives us the public address of the entity which made the function call.
2.  msg.value - Gives us the amount of ether sent (in wei) along with the function call

There are also other special variables like msg.data, msg.gas and msg.sig which you check out in the solidity documentation [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=special%20variables%20and%20functions#block-and-transaction-properties)

While you absorb everything I have mentioned so far. I will explain other functions in detail in next steps.
