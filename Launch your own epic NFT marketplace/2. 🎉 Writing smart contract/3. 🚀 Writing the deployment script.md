# 🎉 Writing smart contract

## 🚀 Writing the deployment script

Alright, time to to deploy our contract.

Deployment of a smart contract is pretty simple actually once you have all of the tools properly set up.

We have gotten most of the things set up already we just have to take care of 2 little things for now.

1.  Ethers.js - Ethers.js is a very popular library, that makes it easy for us to interact with the ethereum network. We will be using this library to deploy our smart contract.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers@^5.0.0
```

1.  To interact with ethereum, we will also need to set up the network we are using to do so. This tutorial is built on the Sepolia test network which allows developers to test out there software without spending real eth.

So go to your hardhat.config.js file and copy the following settings into it.

```js
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
 require('dotenv').config(); //all the key value pairs are being made available due to this lib
 require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
    
 module.exports = {
   solidity: "0.8.17",
   defaultNetwork: 'sepolia',
   networks: {
     hardhat: {},
     sepolia: {
         url: 'https://rpc.sepolia.org',
         accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
     }
   }
 };
```

So a quick explanation of what is happening here.

Remember that .env file you made to store all of your private information.

In the hardhat config file, we are setting up a Sepolia network on hardhat and the private key for your metamask.

We will soon use this network to finally deploy our smart contract.

We are also setting the default solidity compiler version to 0.8.17

Like most other coding languages, solidity also needs to be compiled into a form that the machine can understand.

So to check if everything is working properly let’s quickly compile our contract using hardhat.

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You should be able to see a newly created artifacts folder inside your directory. Keep an eye out for this, because we’ll be using this pretty soon.
