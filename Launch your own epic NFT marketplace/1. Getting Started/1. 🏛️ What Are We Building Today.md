Also, do you know the largest NFT marketplace in the world in the world, Opensea is valued at $13 BILLION!!!! Let's build the next biggest marketplace in the world!

## Course Overview

So what exactly are we going to cover today

-   We will start of with setting up our development environment and downloading all the dependencies. The tech stack we will be using today is - Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, React and Ethers.js
-   We will then use the openzepellin library’s ERC721 smart contract, and inherit it to create our own NFT smart contract called Collection.sol
-   After that we will need to deploy our smart contract using ethers.js and check our deployment on etherscan.
-   Once all the solidity part is done, we’ll make a very simple react frontend for our website.
-   This webpage will be able to list 5 NFTs, a user would be able to connect to their metamask and mint any 2 of these NFTs.
-   And that’s it, you will now be able to see and enjoy your NFT in your own metamask wallet!

Don’t worry if this all seems overwhelming to you. I will help you on each and every step. We are in this together. 😅
