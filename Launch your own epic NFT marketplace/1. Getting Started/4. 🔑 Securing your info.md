Getting Started

##### ðŸ”‘ Securing your info

Storing information the right way
---------------------------------

In this lesson, we will create the .env file and for that we need the HTTP address from quicknode dashboard which you can copy from the dashboard itself and the private key from Metamask

#### Get your private ðŸ¦Š MetaMask key

Open the Metamask extension to find your private key. While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure.

ðŸš¨ DONâ€™T COMMIT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON GITHUB, DONâ€™T SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DONâ€™T SHARE IT ANYWHERE!

IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

ðŸš¨BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!

Great now we have 2 keys in our project, one is the private metamask wallet key, and the other is this private Quicknode HTTP address.

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history. In order to avoid this issue. Letâ€™s do the following.

    `npm install dotenv --save     npx touch .gitignore     touch .gitignore`

ðŸ”¥ This is super important! ðŸ”¥  
  
Go ahead and create .env file at the root of your project. Yes. Your file name would be .env!  
  
Then, open your .gitignore file and write .env there. [Here is a sample .env file that you can replicate.](https://github.com/Metaschoolso/Learning-Projects/blob/main/.env-sample)

All the secrets and important keys related to your project will be stored in .env file and we can access this data whenever and wherever. In the gitignore file we simply write .env, it tells git to ignore that file from future commits.

Open the .env file you have just created. Add your MetaMask Private Key and QuickNode App HTTP URL there. Should be something like this.

    `API_URL_KEY = YOUR_QUICKNODE_APP_URL     PRIVATE_KEY = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`

Now we will be able to securely use all of our private information in this project.

There is one last thing that we have to download before we are FINALLY ready to dive into our smart contract.
