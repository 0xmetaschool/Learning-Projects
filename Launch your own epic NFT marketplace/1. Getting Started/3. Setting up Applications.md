##### Setting up Applications

Creating ü¶ä MetaMask wallet
---------------------------

Your Metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a Metamask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

Metamask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use Metamask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let‚Äôs go!

Here are the installation steps:

*   Go to [MetaMask.io](http://metamask.io/)
*   Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
*   Setup your secure password.
*   The next step is the most important one.
*   Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

_Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C_

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store Ethereum based tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store Ethereum based crypto.

Here are the steps to turn on test networks

1.  Go to settings
2.  Open Advanced
3.  Scroll down to Show Test Networks
4.  Turn on

So, yeah, you must be wondering. I can write, compile and test my smart contract all day on my own computer but how do I connect to the ethereum network?

Do I have to set up my own ethereum node on my server?¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  
Won‚Äôt that be too complicated?

The answer to all those questions is - _QuickNode_.

#### **Creating Quick Node ‚õì endpoint**

Now, we need to set up [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) with Ethereum testnet nodes, it‚Äôs gonna take like 5 mins.

QuickNode is a platform which helps you access the blockchain environment without going through the hassle of hosting your own node, saving time and resources. This platform lets you access blockchain nodes in a few clicks and you can scale the node performance according to your need thus creating an environment for you to scale your DApp.

*   Sign in / Sign up to your¬†[**QuickNode**](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) account
*   Click on create an¬†[**QuickNode**](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=metaschool&utm_content=metaschool-guides&utm_medium=partner) endpoint¬†

*   Now select Ethereum as Network and Goerli as chain and continue
*   We don‚Äôt need any add-on so click¬†**create endpoint** now

Now once you create the endpoint you can start setting up our Metamask Wallet with QuickNode. Now let‚Äôs move to the next part! Hope this was really easy for you to understand!

*   Go to your Metamask wallet and click on the list of networks.

*   A drop-down list will show up with a list of networks but you need to click on¬†**ADD NETWORK** at the bottom of the list
*   Now you will have a form to fill up to add a new network to your metamask account
*   Let‚Äôs go back to QuickNode Endpoint Dashboard, and copy the HTTPS

Now let‚Äôs go back to the Metamask add network form and¬†

*   Paste the HTTPS in¬†**New RPC Url** field with 5 as¬†**Chain ID**,¬†
*   ‚ÄúETH‚Äù as¬†**Currency Symbol**,¬†
*   Ethereum Goerli as¬†**Network Name (Any name as you like)** and¬†
*   Finally¬†[https://goerli.etherscan.io/](https://goerli.etherscan.io/%20) as¬†**Block Explorer URL.**¬†
*   Click Save

#### Get some fake ETH $$ ü§ë

Try the following website and try to get some fake ETHs. This fake money will be used for deploying your contract and doing transactions on your contract. This is not real money, you can‚Äôt buy NFTs, or other assets via these ETH.

All you have to do is to drop your public address on the following links and the ETH will be transferred.
