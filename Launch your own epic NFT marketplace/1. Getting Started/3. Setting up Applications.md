# Setting up Applications

So, yeah, you must be wondering. I can write, compile and test my smart contract all day on my own computer but how do I connect to the network?

Do I have to set up my own node on my server?

Won’t that be too complicated?

The answer to all those questions is - [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

## Get Alchemy HTTP link

Please follow the following steps to get the HTTP link. We will use this link in our config file to connect our app to the Mumbai network.

1. Login to your Alchemy account or create a new account.
2. Go to this link: [https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps).
3. Create new app.
4. Select “Polygon PoS” as your Chain.
5. Choose “Polygon Mumbai” as your Network.
6. Name your app and write description.

9. Copy both of these links as we will use these later. 

## Creating MetaMask wallet

Your metamask wallet is your key to the web3 world. You can interact with the blockchain via a MetaMask account. And of course, generally, it is your digital wallet to store, swap, and buy cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and other amazing things in the web3 world.

MetaMask has a mobile application and a Chrome browser extension too. I personally use MetaMask on my Chrome browser extension because I do most of the work on my laptop.

Anyways, let’s go!

Here are the installation steps:

- Go to [MetaMask.io](http://metamask.io/).
- Click Download and Install the Chrome Extension.
- Setup your secure password.
- The next step is the most important one.
- Secure your 12-word phrase properly, never share it with anyone. Write it somewhere because if you lose it, you will never have a way to recover your account. So be mindful of that.

Congrats! Your account is created and you must have received a public address. The public address will be in the pattern of:

*Example: 0x37EA9984481459885141F571907992e7261E837C*

You can use this public address to buy, trade, and store tokens, cryptos, NFTs and you can even use it to sign in to websites like OpenSea. But are you wondering if it is safe to share this cryptic long address?

Yes, it is completely safe. You can share this address publicly to accept, buy, trade or store crypto.

### Setting up the testnet environment

Complete the following steps:

- Head over to [https://chainlist.org/chain/80001](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001).
- Click on “Connect Wallet”.
- Click on Next, then Connect, then Approve, and finally Switch Network.
- After connecting your wallet, click on “Add to Metamask”.
- Click on Approve and then Switch network.

You will be successfully connected to Mumbai network. See in the following gif how I did it where my wallet is already connected:

### Get some fake MATIC $$ 🤑

Now its time to get some money! 

- Copy your account address.
- Head over to [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).
- Paste your wallet address.

See in the following gif how I did it:

## Get your private MetaMask key

While writing and deploying your contract you sign off each contract with your private key to tell the blockchain that you are a legit person creating a real transaction. Now if that private key is made visible, the hacker can gain access to your account and then the rest will be history.

1. Open the metamask extension to find your private key. 
2. Click on Account.
3. Click on 3 dots on right side and go to “Account Details”.
4. Click on “Show private key”.
5. Enter Metamask password.
6. Copy your private key.

I will tell you how to keep your account and private key safe in the next steps. For now, export the private key and paste it somewhere secure.

🚨 DON’T COMMIT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON GITHUB, DON’T SHARE IT ON DISCORD, DON’T SHARE IT ANYWHERE!

IF YOUR KEY IS PUBLIC, HACKERS AND STEALERS WILL TAKE ALL YOUR FUND AND EVERYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ACCOUNT.

🚨 BE EXTRAAA VIGILANT!!
