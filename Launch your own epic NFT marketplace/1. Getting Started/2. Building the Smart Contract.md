# Building the Smart Contract

## Setting up the environment

So first things first, let’s create a directory for our project.

Go to your command line and enter these commands. ([WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended for easier installation in Windows.)

```
mkdir nft-collection
cd nft-collection
```

Time to set up npm in our project. We will use the node package manager to easily download and manage our dependencies.

```
 npm init --y
```

The output will be like this:

Once you have completed installation, you should see a `package.json` file in your `nft-collection` directory.

Congratulations you have now set up npm and will be easily able to install hardhat and other dependencies.

## Installing Dependencies

We would now need a framework to help us to write, compile, test and deploy our smart contract to make our life easy.

### Presenting to you - Hardhat

Blockchain is like a public database and our smart contracts live on that database. This database is publicly available and accessible. Based on our contract’s configuration, anyone or only specific people can play around with our contract. Every time we publish a contract on blockchain, it gets an address - a digital footprint for us to track it. We’ll build everything in the Ethereum Blockchain and also use Solidity and other libraries for this project.

Publishing a contract directly on blockchain for learning purposes will be an expensive deal. Every time we create a new contract, edit the contract or publish it on the blockchain, we incur some cost in the form of ETH, or MATIC. In order to avoid that and test the contracts properly, we will create a test environment which pretty much replicates the production environment, is free to use, and easy to access.

For this purpose, we will use [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/). Hardhat gives you a local Ethereum network designed for rapid development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code without spending a dime. How cool is that? 😊

So let’s install it using this command

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

> You can check out the [hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) for any help with installation.

Awesome, now let’s set up hardhat by running this command inside our project folder.

```
npx hardhat
```

Since we will be constructing this project from scratch. Just create an **empty hardhat config** file during installation.

Once you have installed hardhat, quickly create 2 new directories - `contracts` and `scripts` in your root directory using the following command. The `contracts` directory will have all your smart contracts and the `scripts` directory will have all the scripts related to deployment of the contract.

```
mkdir contracts scripts
```

## Installing OpenZeppelin

And this might be the most important thing yet - [OPENZEPPELIN](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)

Openzeppelin is a library used for secure and efficient smart contract development.

It is very time consuming to code the ERC721 contract from scratch. So we use already completed and security audited smart contracts from openzeppelin.

So quickly download openzeppelin using this command

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Well done! We have done so much in such a small time. This is how your project folder will look like now.

We will come back to hardhat soon, but before that we need to answer a question.

I can write, compile and test my smart contract all day on my own computer but how do I connect to the ethereum network?

Do I have to set up my own ethereum node on my server?

Won’t that be too complicated?

Well, we’ll answer it in the next lesson, stay tuned!
