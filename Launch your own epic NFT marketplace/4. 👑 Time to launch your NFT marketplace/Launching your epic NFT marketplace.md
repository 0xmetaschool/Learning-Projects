# 👑 Time to launch your NFT marketplace

## Launching your epic NFT marketplace

Run this command in the collections-react directory to start your react app.

```bash
npm run start
```

You should be able to see your NFT marketplace in your browser.

Try clicking random mint buttons and see what happens.

Play around with it, it is yours now!

Take care of 2 things though

1.  That you have enough Sepolia eth in your metamask wallet to buy the NFTs
2.  You can’t mint more than 2 NFT , because we have set a minting limit of one per address. So you can try minting NFTs from other accounts if you want more than 2, or you can re-deploy your smart contract with the new minting limit!

## 👀 Viewing your NFTs in metamask & etherscan

You can now go to the Sepolia etherscan of your smart contract and see the various details of how the mint took place.

You can also check if the NFT has been airdropped to your account or not on Sepolia.etherscan.

1.  Go to [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and check the contract address to see the latest transactions.
2.  Go to [https://testnets.opensea.io/](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and search your contract address to see minted NFTs.

To view your NFTs in your metamask account.

-   Go to metamask’s mobile app.
-   Import your current metamask wallet using the recovery phrase.
-   And then click on import NFTs.
-   Enter your contract address and tokenID (you can find this on etherscan) of the NFT minted here.
-   Refresh metamask a few times, and you now have your own NFT!
