🌈 Making the Frontend of your Marketplace
==========================================

##### Setting up react

### Setting Up React

We will now create the framework for a basic react app quickly using the command.

    `npx create-react-app collections-react` 

You should now see a folder called collections-react with all of the basic react template code inside it.

🚨 Note: You can also make this react app directory separately from the smart contract directory. But to do that you will have to install ethers in the new react directory using this command -

    `npm i ethers` 

### 🪅 Setting Up Pinata

Before we start minting NFTs, we need to define what they will look like.

We need to find images that we want to use, we need to write metadatas for our NFTs (Remember when we talked about metadatas before?)

We are going to provide you with our own images and metadatas to make your work a little bit easier. But if you are feeling creative today, we highly encourage you to put up your own images and create your own metadatas and replace them in the assets folder.

So go ahead and download the “[assets](https://github.com/Metaschoolso/Learning-Projects/tree/main/assets)” folder from here in the public directory of your react app. If you like the assets don’t forget to star us on GitHub. 😘😘

We will be creating 5 NFTs for our marketplace. You can find the images for these NFTs in the assets/images folder.

You can’t pass a complete image to your smart contract. You first need to host it onto a decentralized IPFS (Inter Planetary File System). The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. We will be using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) for storing the metadata of our NFTs.

So go and make a [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) account quickly and come back.

**🚨 This is important, follow the steps quickly.**   
  
Once you login to your pinata dashboard, upload the images folder from assets folder to it. Once you have uploaded the images onto the IPFS, we will now add the individual link of all of these images to their respective metadatas. These metadata files are in your assets folder. So click on the images folder, then click on each individual image and copy its url from the browser. 

Enter this URL into the image field of the metadata that this image corresponds to.

To do this, you now have to go the assets/metadata folder, and fill all 5 of the empty “image” values, with the corresponding IPFS link.

    `{         "description": "This is polar bear NFT",         "image": "<your-image-pinata-link-here>",         "name": "Polar Bear"     }`

Great! Now that you have filled in the metadata folder completely, upload it to the IPFS using Pinata, just like we did for the images!
