# Deploy Your First ERC20 Token on Avalanche

Welcome back! You did great in the last lesson, learning all about writing an ERC20 token in Solidity.

In this lesson, you will learn to compile and deploy your token.

Let’s start this awesome journey!

## Let’s compile, deploy and interact

Remember you made a file in Remix IDE? Paste ERC20 token code in this file. Giving the code again here, so you don’t need to go back to the previous lesson.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyCrypto is ERC20 {

    constructor() ERC20("MetaCoin", "META") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** ERC20.decimals());
    }
}
```

Next, let’s hover to the Solidity compiler. Solidity compiler is a 3rd icon in the list of icons at the side bar. Let me show you where to hover using an image as well, it will help you better than words.

Next, you’ll notice the compiler version set in the compiler is not right. Let’s tick the auto compile flag, which will automatically set the version and compile your contract as well.

> **Note:** In your case, if the box is already ticked don’t untick it.

If Remix throws an error of EVM version incompability or invalid gas estimation, go to Solidity compiler, click on “Advanced Configurations.” There, you’ll find “EVM version” set to “default.” Change the version to “paris” and compile the token again.

Now, I will show you how to deploy your token, but before that you need to connect Remix IDE to your Metamask account.

- Click on deploy icon that is right next to the compile icon in the side bar.
- Click and scroll through the “Environment” bar and select “Injected Provider - Metamask.”
- The Metamask page will appear. Click on “Next” and “Connect” to finally connect your Metamask to Remix IDE.

> **Note:** If your MetaMask is already connected, please deselect and select the MetaMask option again in “Environment” bar to connect with Avalanche network.

Now, let’s look at how this happens live.

Now, we will officially deploy our token.

- Click on “Deploy” button to deploy your contract.
- Click on “Confirm” to confirm the transaction of AVAX from your Metamask.

Let’s look at this happening live in the following GIF.

Great work! I hope you have deployed your contract now. But wait there’s more you need to do 😅. You need to interact with the token and add it to your Metamask. Let’s jump into it right away.

First of all, you need to copy the contract address of your recently deployed token from “Deployed Contracts” section from the side bar. Let’s see how you can do this.

![Frame 3560339 (8).gif](<https://github.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/blob/main/assests_for_all/assets_for_Avalanche_c1/Deploy%20Your%20First%20ERC20%20Token%20on%20Avalanche/Frame_3560339_(8).webp?raw=true>)

Isn’t it fun to copy things? 😅 Anyhow now you need to add the copied address to the Metamask. Open your Metamask, head over to “Import Tokens” option and paste your contract address. (The symbol of the token will automatically be filled).

Awesome, you have added META tokens to your wallet! Now we’re almost at our last step.

Head over to this website: [https://testnet.snowtrace.io/](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/) and paste your contract address to find out more information of your recently deployed token.

## That’s a wrap

Phew! You’ve done it! It was a long process but I’m so glad that you made it this far! And I salute your patience for following each and every step. That’s pretty much it for our course. In next lesson, we will wrap up our course and give you an overview of what you have learned so far.
