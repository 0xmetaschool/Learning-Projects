# Into the World of Avalanche

So hey folks, you just understood what is required to start this course. If you are here, it means you have a knack to learn something new. That something is (you guessed it) the Avalanche Blockchain!!

## What the heck is Avalanche?

So, what even is Avalanche and why should you know about it?

It's a super cool platform that's open-source and perfect for creating decentralized apps (dApps) and enterprise blockchain stuff. Basically, it helps developers build awesome applications and protocols that work with smart contracts.

It's a dope blockchain platform that's all about solving the big challenge of scalability, security, and decentralization, aka the "blockchain trilemma" thanks to its unique Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. Basically, Avalanche is all about finding a balance so that blockchain can handle a ton of transactions, stay super secure, and keep things nice and decentralized.

Now how do you pay for transactions on Avalanche? Well AVAX is the answer to this. AVAX plays an important role as the native token of the Avalanche chain and it works similar to how ETH works for Ethereum, that is, every transaction on Avalanche requires a gas fee and AVAX is spent on chain as gas.

## Avalanche programming language

What programming language does Avalanche use? You might have figured it out so far that Avalanche uses Solidity programming language. Using the famous language in web3 ecosystem gives so much edge to Avalanche blockchain.

## Thatâ€™s a wrap

In a nutshell, Avalanche is a super cool open-source blockchain platform that helps developers create decentralized apps (dApps) and enterprise blockchain solutions.

In the next lesson, we will set up the environment for writing our own contract. Don't forget to complete the assignment before moving on to the next lesson!
