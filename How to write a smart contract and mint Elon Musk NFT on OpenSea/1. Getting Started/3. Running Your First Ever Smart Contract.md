# Running Your First Ever Smart Contract

Great job on setting up your HardHat project. Now, we will move forward and learn how we can run the smart contract that exist in the HardHat project.

## Run your first smart contract

Write the following code in the terminal and hit enter. Make sure you still are in your project directory in your terminal.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

You will see something like this on your terminal.

```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully (evm target: paris).
Lock with 0.001ETH and unlock timestamp 1720701061 deployed to 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

Congratulations! you've been successful in deploying your first smart contract to your local blockchain environment without having to code a single line.

### So, what happened here?

When you run the above command, your solidity code is converted into bytecode. A new local blockchain is created and your contract is deployed there. But this blockchain is not permanent, every time you build and run your smart contract, a new blockchain is created in your local environment and the contract is deployed. So it is more like a clean slate - start from scratch. We will get back to it later and figure out a way to deploy our contract permanently. For now, just a piece of information for you to digest.

```
Lock with 0.001ETH and unlock timestamp 1720701061 deployed to 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

Also, the output line have numbers that is the address where your contract is deployed. Every contract has its own address. Because of hardhat we were able to create a local blockchain environment just like Ethereum where we can deploy contracts and play around with them free of cost.

## Project structure

Let's open your project in VSCode or Sublime or any other IDE your prefer. The structure will look something like this.

## Lock.sol file

Now, let's us open the `Lock.sol` file and understand the structure of the smart contract. By the way, `.sol` file stands for Solidity.

```
/ SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

// Uncomment this line to use console.log
// import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Lock {
    uint public unlockTime;
    address payable public owner;

    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);

    constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable {
        require(
            block.timestamp < _unlockTime,
    "Unlock time should be in the future"
        );

        unlockTime = _unlockTime;
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
  }

    function withdraw() public {
    // Uncomment this line, and the import of "hardhat/console.sol", to print a log in your terminal
    // console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);

        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime,
    "You can't withdraw yet");
        require(msg.sender == owner,
    "You aren't the owner");

        emit Withdrawal(address(this).balance, block.timestamp);

        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }
}

```

### Understanding the smart contract

This code defines a Solidity contract named `Lock`. The contract has the following variables:

- **`unlockTime`:** a public `uint` (unsigned integer) that stores the time at which the lock can be unlocked.
- `**owner**`_:_ a public address (an address is a type in Solidity that represents the address of an Ethereum account) that stores the owner of the contract. It is marked `payable` to indicate that the contract can receive Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum).
- The contract also has an event named `Withdrawal` that can be used to track when someone calls the `withdraw()` function and gets a payment from the contract.
- The contract has one function, also named `withdraw`. This function can be called by anyone, but it has some requirements:
  - The caller must be the owner of the contract.
  - The current block timestamp must be greater than or equal to the `unlockTime`.
- If these requirements are met, the function will do the following:
  - Emit the `Withdrawal` event, passing in the current balance of the contract and the current block timestamp as arguments.
  - Transfer the entire balance of the contract to the owner's account.
- The contract also has a constructor function, which is a special function that is called when the contract is first deployed to the Ethereum network.
  - The constructor takes one argument: `unlockTime`, which is the desired unlock time for the contract. The constructor does the following:
    - It checks that the current block timestamp is less than `\_unlockTime`, and if it is not, it will throw an error with the message `"Unlock time should be in the future"`.
    - It sets the value of the `unlockTime` variable to be equal to `\_unlockTime`.
    - It sets the value of the owner variable to be equal to the address of the account that deployed the contract (the msg.sender).
- The pragma statement at the top of the file is used to specify the version of Solidity that the code is written in. The `//` syntax indicates a single-line comment that is ignored by the compiler.

## Deploy.js file

Now let’s open the `deploy.js` in the scripts folder.

```
// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// You can also run a script with `npx hardhat run <script>`. If you do that, Hardhat
// will compile your contracts, add the Hardhat Runtime Environment's members to the
// global scope, and execute the script.
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const currentTimestampInSeconds = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);
  const ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
  const unlockTime = currentTimestampInSeconds + ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS;

  const lockedAmount = hre.ethers.utils.parseEther("1");

  const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

  await lock.deployed();

  console.log(
    `Lock with 1 ETH and unlock timestamp ${unlockTime} deployed to ${lock.address}`
  );
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});

```

### Understanding the deployment code

The above code is written in JavaScript and is intended to be run using the Hardhat Ethereum development environment. It defines an async function named `main()` that does the following:

- It calculates the current timestamp in seconds, and stores it in the `currentTimestampInSeconds` variable.
- It defines a constant named `ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS` and sets it to the number of seconds in one year.
- It calculates the unlock time for the contract by adding `ONE_YEAR_IN_SECS` to the `currentTimestampInSeconds`, and stores the result in the unlockTime variable.
- It defines a constant named `lockedAmount` and sets it to the value of 1 Ether, using the `parseEther` method from the `ethers.utils` library.
- It gets the contract factory for the `Lock` contract, which allows it to deploy new instances of the contract.
- It deploys a new instance of the `Lock` contract, passing in the `unlockTime` as an argument, and sending `lockedAmount` worth of Ether along with the deployment transaction.
- It waits for the contract to be fully deployed to the Ethereum network.
- It logs a message to the console with the address of the deployed contract and the calculated unlock time.
- The code then calls the `main()` function and uses a catch block to handle any errors that may occur.
- The `const hre = require("hardhat");` line at the top of the file imports the Hardhat Runtime Environment, which provides a set of tools and libraries for working with Ethereum contracts.
- The `const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");` line gets the contract factory for the `Lock` contract, which is a JavaScript object that can be used to deploy new instances of the contract.
- The `const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });` line uses the contract factory to deploy a new instance of the `Lock` contract, passing in the `unlockTime` as an argument, and sending `lockedAmount` worth of Ether along with the deployment transaction. The `await lock.deployed();` line waits for the contract deployment to be fully processed by the Ethereum network.

How about you deploy the contract by uncommenting the console log library, and console messages in the `deploy.js` file.

Also, why don't you deploy the contract again with 2 ETH in lock?
