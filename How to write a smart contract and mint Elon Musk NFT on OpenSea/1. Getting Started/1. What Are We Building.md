# What are We Building Today?

gm everyone ðŸŒˆ, we are very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial for developers on MetaSchool.

So what are we building today? Today we're gonna write a smart contract and mint an image of Elon Musk with the help of that smart contract on blockchain. This project is SO important, because not only will it give you basic understanding of how smart contracts work, but will also help you understand how big collections of NFTs are programmatically minted on different NFT platforms. Cool, right?!

## Course overview

We will:

1. Cover some super cool tools that you need to interact with as a smart contract developer.
2. Understand devnet, testnet and mainnet
3. Mint an NFT

Please install VScode and node on your machine. Install [node from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download [VScode from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Proof of completion

If you complete this course with me, you will be getting XPs and a special NFT which will unlock many more opportunities for you on the Metaschool platform. Here is what the NFT looks like.
