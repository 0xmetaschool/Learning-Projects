# üèõÔ∏è What Are We Building Today?

gm everyone üåà, I am [Fama](https://twitter.com/fatimarizwan) and along with Harpal, we are very excited to bring the first ever learning tutorial for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building today? Today we're gonna write a smart contract and mint an image of Elon Musk with the help of that smart contract on blockchain. This project is SO important, because not only will it give you basic understanding of how smart contracts work, but will also help you understand how big collections of NFTs are programmatically minted on different NFT platforms. Cool, right?!

Not only that, do you know in 2021 alone, the total sales volume of NFTs reached over $10 BILLION?!

## Course Overview

We will:

1.  Cover some super cool tools that you need to interact with as a smart contract developer.
2.  Understand devnet, testnet and mainnet
3.  Mint an NFT

## Who exactly should take this course?
This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about the NFTs and is excited to deploy their own NFT collection.
