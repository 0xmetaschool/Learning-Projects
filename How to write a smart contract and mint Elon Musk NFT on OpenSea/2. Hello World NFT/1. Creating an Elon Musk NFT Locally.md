# Creating an Elon Musk NFT Locally

Welcome back! Great work on learning all about the HardHat project and the files it creates by default. Now, we will move forward and add files to our HardHat project.

## Create `ElonNFT` contract

In the `contracts` folder, create a new file named `Elon.sol`. This is your new contract file.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.9; //this is the version of the solidity we are using in this contract.

import "hardhat/console.sol"; //this is given to us by hardhat to debug our code. It is very helpful in local environment.

contract ElonNFT {
    constructor() {
        console.log("This is my Elon Musk NFT contract!!");
    }
}
```

### Understanding the code

This code defines a Solidity contract named "ElonNFT".

- The contract has a `constructor` function, which is a special function that is called when the contract is first deployed to the Ethereum network.
- The pragma statement at the top of the smart contract specifies the version of Solidity that the code is written in.
- The import statement includes the `console.sol` library, which is provided by the Hardhat Ethereum development environment and allows you to print messages to the console for debugging purposes.
- The constructor function simply logs a message to the console using the `console.log` function, which was imported from the `console.sol` library. When the contract is deployed, this message will be printed to the console.

I hope the explanation makes it super simple for you to understand the above code.

Now let's go to the deployment file.

## Deployment file

First things first, I will rename the `deploy.js` file to `run.js` and then I will make some changes to the file. You can go ahead and copy them.

```
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  console.log("Deploying Contract...");
  const elon = await hre.ethers.deployContract("ElonNFT");
  console.log("Contract deployed to address:", elon.target);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

### Understanding the code

The above code is almost same as our `Lock` contract related script. But I have made some changes. Now I am calling the const to store our contract as `ElonNFT` which is our contract name and then deploying it using the terminal.

It defines an async function named `main()` that does the following:

- It gets the contract factory for the `ElonNFT` contract, which allows it to deploy new instances of the contract.
- It deploys a new instance of the `ElonNFT` contract.
- It waits for the contract to be fully deployed to the Ethereum network.
- It logs a message to the console with the address of the deployed contract.

The code then calls the `main()` function and uses a catch block to handle any errors that may occur. It also uses the then function to specify that the process should exit with a code of `0` (success) after the `main()` function completes. If an error occurs, the process will exit with a code of `1` (failure).

## Run deployment

First, run the following command to compile the smart contract

```
npx hardhat compile
```

Youâ€™ll see an output similar to this:

```
Downloading compiler 0.8.9
Compiled 2 Solidity file successfully
```

Now, run the script file using the following command.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```

Once the contract is deployed, we will see the constructor message on screen and the address where the contract is deployed to.

```
Deploying Contract...
This is my Elon Musk NFT contract!!
Contract deployed to address: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

BOOOOMM!! Your first NFT contract is deployed. Give yourself a pat on the back.

Next, we will write the minting script for our NFT contract.
