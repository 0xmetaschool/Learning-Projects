# Adding Image to NFT

So, you’ve learned how to create, deploy, and mint your token locally. Now, let’s move forward and give a visual look to our NFT.

Every NFT has some data linked to it in the form of JSON format that describes the NFT. We call it metadata. This metadata has a special JSON format and the format needs to be followed if we want our NFT to appear properly on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, etc.

In the previous lesson, I shared how we wrote ‘Hello World’ instead of sharing the Uniform Resource Identifier, I mean, the data about the NFT.

Let's look back at it.

```
_setTokenURI(newItemId, "Hello World");
```

Now we will use the standard format required by NFT platforms to describe the data related to the NFT.

## Get started with Pinata IPFS

First of all, we will upload our chosen image to Pinata. You can choose any image you want to choose but we need to follow a certain method to make a normal image to an NFT.

So what is Pinata? It works like a peer-to-peer database storage system. Here, we save our data and access it using a URL. So, here’s what we’re gonna do.

1. Signup to Pinata
2. Upload an image to Pinata
3. Fetch the image URL
4. Add image URL to JSON file and create metadata
5. Upload metadata JSON file to IPFS

So, I have given you an overview here. Let’s move onto actually doing it.

### Signup to Pinata

Head over to [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) and create a free account.

1. Click on the “Start Building” button. It will take you to the signup page.
2. Enter your email address, select “Builder” in the title section, and move “Next.”
3. Set your first name, last name and password.
4. Confirm your email by entering the confirmation code.
5. Your Pinata profile is ready to go. Here’s what it will look like:

### Upload an image to Pinata

Next, you need to upload an image file to the Pinata dashboard.

1. Click on the “+ Add Files” button and select “File”.
2. Click on the “Select a file” button, browse through your folder, find the image you want to upload, and select it.

I am downloading the image from Google. You can download any other image. Here’s how I’m doing it:

### Fetch the image URL

Now that you have uploaded the image to Pinata. You need to fetch the URL.

1. Click on the uploaded image's file name on pinata which will open the image in a new tab.
2. Copy the URL of the image.

### Add image URL to JSON file and create metadata

Now, create a new file named `Elon_musk.json` file wherever you want. I created the file outside of my HardHat project. Paste the following code and update the image URL with your image URL.

```
{
	"name":"Elon Musk",
	"description":"Making inter planetory travel possible and pushing the boundaries for mankind.",
	"image":"YOUR-IMAGE-PINATA-URL",

	"attributes":
	[
		{
			"trait_type":"Zodiac","value":"Cancer"
		},
		{
			"trait_type":"Height","value":"6'1"
		},
		{	"trait_type":"Personality Type","value":"INTJ"
		}
	]
}

```

### Upload metadata JSON file to IPFS

Now that you have created the JSON file, follow the following step.

1. Upload the JSON file to Pinata.
2. Copy the Pinata JSON public link from the “Share” button.

You’re done with Pinata. Now, we need to update the link in `Elon.sol` file. Let’s do that.

## Update `Elon.sol` file

Coming back, we will pass on the JSON metadata url and deploy our contract. Remember to update this in `Elon.sol` file.

```
_setTokenURI(newItemId, "YOUR-JSON-FILE-LINK-FROM-PINATA");
```

Let's deploy our contract using `npx hardhat run scripts/run.js` command. You will see this output.

```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully
Deploying Contract...
Contract deployed to address: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Minting NFT...
The NFT ID 1 has been minted to 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266
```

We are reaching the very last part of this project where we will deploy this contract to testnet and then production as well.

Are you excited? I am very excited!!!!!!!!!
