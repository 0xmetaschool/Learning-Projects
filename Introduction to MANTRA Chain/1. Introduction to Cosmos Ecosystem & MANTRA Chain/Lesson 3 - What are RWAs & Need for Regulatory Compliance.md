# What are RWAs & Need for Regulatory Compliance

Welcome back, learners! In our last lesson, we explored the exciting Cosmos ecosystem and its unique approach to blockchain interoperability. Now, we know you're eager to dive into MANTRA Chain, but before we do, let's build a strong foundation for understanding this innovative blockchain.

In this lesson, we will learn about What are RWAs? The need for liquidity in RWAs and the need for regulatory compliance in the digital asset space. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid grasp of the key concepts that underpin MANTRA Chain's vision and mission. So, get ready to expand your knowledge and prepare for a deep dive into the exciting world of RWAs!

## What are Real-World Assets?

We have seen the term “real-world assets” a lot since the last lesson, it's high time we actually define RWAs.

Simply put, real-world assets are tangible or intangible things of value that exist in the physical world – not just in the digital realm. They can be anything from physical assets like real estate, gold, cars, art, etc.

Think of it this way: if you can touch it, own it, or trade it in the traditional financial world, it's likely a real-world asset.

### What is the role of Blockchain technology in expanding access to RWAs

RWAs have always been a cornerstone of the global economy. They represent real value and offer various investment opportunities. However, investing in RWAs has often been exclusive, and limited to wealthy individuals or institutions.

This is where blockchain technology steps in, offering a potential game-changer. Blockchain can revolutionize the way we interact with RWAs by:

- **Tokenization:** Turning RWAs into digital tokens on the blockchain makes them easier to buy, sell, and trade. This unlocks liquidity and opens up investment opportunities to a broader audience.
- **Fractional Ownership:** Blockchain enables fractional ownership of RWAs, allowing investors to own a small portion of an asset that would otherwise be too expensive to purchase outright.
- **Transparency and Security:** Blockchain's immutable ledger ensures transparency and security in RWA transactions, reducing fraud and increasing trust.
- **Global Accessibility:** Blockchain removes geographical barriers, allowing investors from around the world to access and invest in RWAs.

In the next section, we'll delve deeper into why RWAs need liquidity and how blockchain can address this need. So, buckle up as we explore the exciting potential of RWAs in the world of blockchain!

## The Need for Liquidity in RWAs

While RWAs offer promising investment opportunities, they come with a significant challenge: liquidity.

**What is Liquidity?**

Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. Cash is the most liquid asset, as it can be easily exchanged for goods and services. However, RWAs like real estate or fine art are much less liquid. In the traditional market, it can take weeks or even months to find a buyer or seller, and the price you get might not always be fair. The process is far more opaque and restrictive.

**Challenges with Traditional RWA Investments:**

1. **Illiquidity:** As mentioned above, RWAs are not easily converted into cash. This means your investment is locked up, and you might not be able to access your money quickly if needed.
2. **High Barriers to Entry:** Many RWAs require significant capital to invest, making them inaccessible to most people. For example, buying a property or investing in a large-scale infrastructure project requires a substantial amount of money upfront.
3. **Lack of Transparency:** Traditional RWA markets often lack transparency. Information about ownership, valuations, and transactions can be difficult to obtain, making it hard for investors to make informed decisions.

**How Tokenization Unlocks Liquidity:**

Tokenization is the process of converting RWAs into digital tokens on the blockchain. These tokens represent fractional ownership of the underlying asset. For example, a real estate property worth \$1 million could be divided into 1 million tokens, each worth $1. This makes investing in RWAs more accessible and affordable for everyone.

But tokenization does more than just make RWAs affordable. It also significantly improves their liquidity. In theory, tokenized RWAs could be tradeable on digital exchanges 24/7, just like cryptocurrencies. This means you can buy or sell your share of a real estate property, a piece of art, or even a racehorse with a few clicks, at any time.

By increasing liquidity, tokenization opens up new opportunities for investors and asset owners. It allows investors to diversify their portfolios and access asset classes that were previously out of reach. For asset owners, it provides a new way to raise capital and unlock the value of their assets.

As we've seen, tokenization has the potential to unlock immense value in the world of RWAs. But for this potential to be fully realized, it's crucial to address another key factor: regulatory compliance.

Let's delve into why navigating the regulatory landscape is so important for the future of RWAs in the digital asset space.

## The Need for Regulatory Compliance in the Digital Asset Space

As the world of digital assets continues to evolve, so does the regulatory landscape surrounding it. Governments and financial authorities worldwide are grappling with how to oversee this rapidly growing space. Some countries are embracing blockchain and crypto, while others are taking a more cautious approach.

**Why Compliance Matters:**

Regardless of the specific regulations in each jurisdiction, one thing is clear: compliance is crucial for the long-term success and adoption of digital assets. Here's why:

1. **Building Trust:** Clear and consistent regulations create a framework for trust. When investors and institutions know that there are rules in place to protect them, they are more likely to participate in the market.
2. **Protecting Consumers:** Regulations help protect consumers from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. By setting standards for transparency, security, and fair practices, regulators can ensure that investors are not taken advantage of.
3. **Preventing Illicit Activities:** Unfortunately, the anonymity and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies have sometimes attracted bad actors who use them for illegal activities. Robust regulations help prevent and deter such activities, making the digital asset space safer for everyone.
4. **Fostering Innovation:** While it might seem counterintuitive, appropriate regulation can actually foster innovation. By providing a clear legal framework, regulators create a stable environment where businesses can develop new products and services with confidence. This can lead to the creation of innovative financial solutions that benefit consumers and businesses alike.
5. **Mainstream Adoption:** For digital assets to truly go mainstream, they need to be embraced by traditional financial institutions. These institutions are unlikely to get involved unless there are clear regulations in place. Compliance is therefore a key stepping stone to wider adoption.
