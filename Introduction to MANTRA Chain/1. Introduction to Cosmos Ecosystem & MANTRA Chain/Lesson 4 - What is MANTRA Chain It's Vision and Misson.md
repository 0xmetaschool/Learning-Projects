# What is MANTRA Chain? It's Vision and Mission

Welcome back, fellow developers! üéâ

We are on an exhilarating journey to explore the groundbreaking MANTRA Chain. So far, we‚Äôve taken the first two steps (give yourself a pat on the back‚Äîthose initial strides are always the toughest!). We‚Äôve delved into the Cosmos ecosystem and dived deep into the fascinating world of Real-World Assets (RWAs). But now, it‚Äôs time for our next adventure: understanding MANTRA Chain itself.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll dive deep into MANTRA Chain, discover its inspiring vision and mission, and explore why it‚Äôs set to create ripples in the decentralized finance universe. So fasten your seatbelts, my fellow crypto enthusiasts, because we‚Äôre about to dive headfirst into this revolutionary blockchain! üöÄüí°

## What is MANTRA Chain?

MANTRA Chain is a cutting-edge blockchain network, designed from the ground up to bring real-world assets (RWAs) onto the blockchain, making them easily accessible and tradable.

But here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äì it‚Äôs all done by the book, with dApps built for RWAs following the same rules as the regular financial world.

It's built with regulatory compliance in mind, so you can be confident that your tokenized assets adhere to the same rigorous standards as their traditional counterparts. It's all about keeping things legit and above board! This means you can explore the exciting world of tokenized assets with the confidence and security you're used to.

So, when we say that ‚ÄúMANTRA is a security-first RWA Layer 1 Blockchain bringing the world‚Äôs financial system onchain‚Äù. What it really means is that MANTRA Chain is like the first layer of a new internet for trading real stuff, and it‚Äôs all set up to play nice with the rules. And yeah, those last couple of chapters you read? They totally set you up to understand this!"

## Permissionless Layer 1 blockchain designed for Permissioned applications

MANTRA Chain is all about staying ahead of the game when it comes to rules and regulations. It‚Äôs believed that public blockchains will be the settlement layer for tokenized RWAs, and that the application layer is where regulators will focus. That‚Äôs why MANTRA is an open-invite blockchain (that‚Äôs what ‚Äòpermissionless‚Äô means) that‚Äôs also totally prepped to handle dApps that need authorized access (permissioned).

Think of it like a public park that's also designed for private events. The park is open to everyone (permissionless), but there are certain areas that can be reserved for specific groups or activities (permissioned).

In the same way, MANTRA Chain is a blockchain that anyone can join and use. However, it also allows for the creation of special, regulated sections where only authorized participants can access and trade specific assets. This is ideal for tokenizing regulated real-world assets like stocks or bonds, which require stricter controls to comply with financial laws.

So, MANTRA offers the best of both worlds: the openness, composability and flexibility of a public blockchain with the security and compliance features needed for traditional financial assets.

To empower developers in creating compliant applications (applications that follow the rules and regulations in their specific jurisdiction), MANTRA Chain provides a comprehensive environment designed specifically for this purpose. This environment equips developers with the necessary components to build regulated, compliant, and permissioned applications on top of MANTRA's high-performance, scalable blockchain architecture.

This allows for the creation of Web3 applications that not only leverage the benefits of decentralization but also adhere to the necessary regulatory frameworks. This unique combination of permissionless infrastructure and permissioned application development makes MANTRA Chain a powerful platform for the future of regulated digital assets, while also providing an attractive space for developers seeking to build innovative, decentralized applications without regulatory constraints.

## Why MANTRA Chain matter?

So, you know how the Cosmos ecosystem is huge with 50+ blockchains. Well, there‚Äôs been a piece missing ‚Äì a blockchain that‚Äôs all about following the rules, especially for assets that exist in the real world and those that are digital tokens. That‚Äôs where MANTRA Chain comes in. It‚Äôs like the missing piece that‚Äôs all about being on the right side of the law.

Here‚Äôs the scoop on why MANTRA Chain is pretty awesome:

- **Playing by the Rules:** MANTRA Chain is providing all the necessary tools to build regulatory-compliant dApps, ensuring that when you engage with the permissioned blockchain segment, you can be confident in the high standard of compliance it offers.
- **Attracting Diverse Users:** By offering a permissioned environment, MANTRA Chain is rolling out the red carpet for all kinds of investors, including the big fish in the pond who like everything neat and tidy, legally speaking.
- **Fostering Innovation:** MANTRA Chain‚Äôs permissioned environment is like a playground for smart folks who want to create cool financial apps. It follows all the safety rules, while keeping the spirit of freedom and innovation alive.
- **Global Reach:** With its eyes on the prize of being aligned with authorities all over the planet, MANTRA Chain is on its way to becoming a worldwide hotspot for investing in tokenized goodies.

With its unique combination of regulatory compliance, technological innovation, and global vision, MANTRA Chain is poised to lead the way in the new era of decentralized finance.

## What is the vision and mission of MANTRA Chain?

Imagine MANTRA Chain as a visionary architect in the finance world. It‚Äôs not just another block in the blockchain neighborhood. It‚Äôs got a grand plan to change how we deal with money, making sure that stuff like houses, gold, or even paintings can move into the blockchain neighborhood smoothly.

It‚Äôs all about connecting the old-school money ways (that‚Äôs TradFi) with the cool, new decentralized finance scene (yep, that‚Äôs DeFi), making it easier for everyone to get in on different kinds of investments and making those investments flow better.

To achieve this vision, MANTRA Chain has built a robust and scalable blockchain architecture on the Cosmos SDK, designed to handle the complexity of real-world asset tokenization with security, transparency, and efficiency.

MANTRA Chain offers a robust environment and infrastructure for developing products in both permissioned and permissionless manners. For the permissioned sector, MANTRA Chain is dedicated to create infrastructure that is adhering to regulatory compliance and providing essential tools for building secure, compliant applications. Meanwhile, for the permissionless sector, MANTRA Chain invites everyone to innovate and experiment on an open and accessible platform.

And here‚Äôs the heart of it all: MANTRA‚Äôs mission is to make the financial world a place where anyone can participate. They‚Äôre building a system that‚Äôs open and fair, giving people everywhere the chance to grow their wealth with all sorts of assets. That‚Äôs the spirit driving MANTRA Chain ‚Äì to create a financial playground that‚Äôs inclusive, innovative, and full of possibilities for everyone.

By addressing the challenges of liquidity, accessibility, and regulatory compliance, MANTRA Chain is paving the way for a new era of financial innovation and inclusion.
